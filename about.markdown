## Setting
Roughly nine years have passed since the inception of the Great War, the machines of war lie silent for now. Despite the sense of jubilation and rejuvenation in Europe, photos of children and parents - those who never returned from the war were moved from the parlour to the attic, where they gathered dust.

he Titan War to end all Titan Wars has also ended. With it, began a divine cold war. Pantheons of the world manoeuvred their forces in this new Great Game, yet no one's willing to throw the first stone. Fear and paranoia spread like a plague across the overworlds, no one could tell whether it was the former or the latter that drove the lord of Olympus to depraved acts of filicide, for the fates ordained that he was doomed to be overthrown by one his own Scions. The rest of Olympus remained silent.

You and your travelling companions are Scions of Zeus, caught in this delicate mutually assured destruction scenario and your divine father's wrath. Strikeout on your own in this brave new world. Will you choose a life of obscurity to hide from the eye of the storm? Or face the thunderclouds and fulfil the prophecy by striking down the dreaded lord of Olympus himself?

## What is this

This is a tabletop campaign using an **extremely heavily modified** version of the first edition of the Scion roleplaying system. Set in a world very similar to ours in the 1920s. Unlike our world a century ago, occupations are open to all genders, and there's a distinct lack of sexual discrimination in most parts of the world, while racial and language barriers continued to divide those who inhabit the mortal realm. 

The decision to handwave the rampant sexism of the 1920s was made to improve the player experience for those who roleplay female characters. The other prejudices were intentionally left behind to trouble and disturb the players. For I lack the creative fineness and grace to inject modern-day political beliefs into a historical setting, lest they overshadow the real horrors and atrocities that haunted the early 20th century. 

## Expectations

This is a game about constantly being on a run, a story of desperation, occultism, and a celebration of humanity. The tone of the game is intended to be somewhere between 'The Running Man' (1987), 'Shanghai Express' (1932), and The Shawshank Redemption (1994). 

The game may contain the following content: Occultism in the early 20th century, organised crime, the spectre of war, and its crippling effects on those that survived through it, death, hope, grand operas, silent pantomimes, flowers, financial crisis, ecdysis, the scent of freshly baked bread, cats, diasporas, unspeakable things lurking on the edge of everyone's mind, whispers of moths, Saudade, hiraeth, and the promise of home.

Content may disturb.
