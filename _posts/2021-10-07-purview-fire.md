### FIRE IMMUNITY ●
**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion is unaffected by flames; she cannot be burnt by fire and her lungs are impervious to smoke damage. This protection does not extend to her clothes or to anything she might be carrying.

### BOLSTER FIRE ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon may encourage flame wherever he sees it, increasing its size (up to a maximum of a large campfire) and removing its need for fuel, allowing it to continue burning for the duration of the scene regardless of its environment (this does not give him any control over the fire’s behavior; he merely enables it to grow larger). Alternatively, he may also create a small flame at his fingertip, suitable as a light source or in order to ignite an appropriate substance; however, this separate use of the Boon costs a Legend on its own, so a Scion must spend 2 Legend to use both abilities in the same scene.

### CREATIVE SPARK ●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Internalizing its untamable energies, the Scion with this Boon is able to channel the changing, reshaping power of flame through her own efforts. By concentrating fully on a flame (a 2 turn action) or touching one, she may add her total number of Fire Boons as automatic successes to any Art rolls she makes for the remainder of the scene.

### FIRE’S EYE ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Awareness

Now attuned to the volatile nature of flame, the Scion may use it as a conduit through which to pass her consciousness. By spending the requisite cost and choosing any fire that she can see or that she has previously used the Bolster Fire Boon on, she may look through the fire and see what is happening in its immediate area as though she were there. For every five successes scored on the activation roll, she may project herself more fully into the flames, gaining on additional sense (hearing, smell, etc). The Scion is unable to use any projected senses at her body while doing so, and is therefore vulnerable since she might be unaware of impending danger.

### QUENCH ●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Survival

The Scion with this Boon may control the unruly rampage of flame instead of encouraging it, lessening its destructive potential or even snuffing it out entirely. By spending the activation cost, the Scion may immediately extinguish all non-magical flames within a radius equal to his successes in yards, ending wildfires and building conflagrations with ease. Alternatively, he may remove any additional flames spawned by uses of the Fire purview, but he may only quench flames spun away from the use of a Fire Boon, not flames created by the Boon itself (i.e., he could contain someone else’s use of Inferno by preventing it from spreading to nearby areas, but he could not quench the Inferno itself).

### SUMMON SALAMANDERS ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

By calling forth in a commanding manner, the Scion may summon salamanders to do her bidding. Upon being summoned, the salamanders must be paid with their preferred price, a damp log (alternatively, they will accept a magical item – a trinket, relic, or trophy – or a lump-sum payment of 3 Legend per salamander; however, these alternatives become very expensive very quickly); if they are not paid, they will refuse to obey the Scion’s commands and may even intentionally cause mischief for her before vanishing again. The summoned salamanders possess the Fire Immunity and Bolster Fire Boons, and can work tirelessly at simple tasks (digging, cleaning, non-flammable errands, etc.), though more complicated orders may pose difficulties. For every three successes she garners on her activation roll, the Scion may choose to either summon an additional salamander or to add one day to the time that they will remain to serve her. If no extra days are purchased with successes, the salamanders depart at sunset.

### BLAZING WEAPON ●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Occult

The Scion may create a weapon from any available flame and wield it as if it were solid, igniting obstacles and enemies upon impact; alternatively, he may cause an aura of flame to spring up around a weapon he already has, giving it the same bonuses. If he augments an existing weapon, the Scion may add his successes as bonus dice to the weapon’s damage, up to a maximum of his number of Fire Boons; if he creates a new weapon from flame, he may divide his successes as bonuses to its damage, accuracy, or defense (with the same maximum). The Scion may also choose to divide his successes in order to light several nearby allies’ weapons on fire, apportioning them the same way. If any person or creature without the Fire Immunity Boon attempts to handle the weapon, they suffer one unsoakable level of lethal damage for every turn that they do not release it.

### FLAMIN’ BULLETS ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon may combine godly powers with modern weaponry, creating flaming projectiles for her firearms or other ranged weapons. All of the Scion’s ammunition bursts into continual flame once used for the remainder of the scene, and sets flammable targets on fire as well as adding one automatic success to the damage and accuracy of attacks made with it. If any person or creature without the Fire Immunity Boon attempts to handle the ammunition or a weapon it is loaded into, they will suffer one unsoakable level of lethal damage for every turn that they do not release it.

### HALO OF FIRE ●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion creates a burning halo of fire around his entire body, singeing nearby people and objects and igniting any flammable items within a foot. If he successfully strikes any person or creature in hand-to-hand combat, that creature suffers an extra amount of lethal damage equal to his total number of Fire Boons; if he successfully grapples, that creature suffers twice that amount of lethal damage for every action that it remains within the grapple as the Scion sears its flesh from its bones (if the Scion has the Devil Body Boon, its effects occur in addition to these). Those with Fire Immunity are unaffected by this Boon, the effects of which dissipate at the end of the scene.

### DRAGON’S BREATH ●●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Survival

The Scion transforms his body into a raging internal furnace, the flames and heat of which he may release via his mouth, frightening onlookers, destroying obstacles, or burning his enemies. He may breathe out a cone of blistering flame with a range equal to his number of Fire Boons in feet; should he hit a living thing (which may attempt to dodge out of the way with a Dexterity + Athletics roll), the flame does an amount of lethal damage equal to his Stamina roll plus 5, added to his threshold successes.

### FLAME TRAVEL ●●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon has become so closely linked to flame that she may use it as a pathway, entering any fire large enough to accept her body and re-emerging in any other that is either within line of sight or that she has previously used the Bolster Fire Boon on. This does not require an action, and may be used reflexively at any time that the Scion is moving and has an appropriate source of flame.

### SACRED HEARTH ●●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 2 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By consecrating the flames of a hearth, the Scion may grant it the ability to buttress and comfort her allies, making it a focal point at which anyone may rest safely. Whenever she chooses, he may pay the activation cost to bless a fire (it need not be in a traditional hearth, but it must be a fire that the Scion has built himself, whether through mundane or magical means); for as long as that flame continues to burn, the building, camp, or other locale where it is situated becomes a safe zone. All who remain within the fire’s circle of light gain the Scion’s total number of Fire Boons as bonus dice against the effects of any Darkness, Chaos, Frost or Moon Boons, and gain the same number of bonus dice to all Perception rolls made to recognize an ambush of the site. In addition, anyone who rests for a full six hours beside the hearth fire regains one point of Willpower (this cannot exceed their normal maximum). The flame remains beneficial and holy until the Scion himself leaves, or until it is quenched or allowed to go out.

### FLAMEBORN SPIRIT ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

When a Scion possesses this boon, her control over flame is so great that she may summon up its very spirit to act on her behalf. Upon paying the requisite cost, the Scion summons a ten-foot-tall fire elemental of enormous strength and endurance which obeys her commands to the best of its ability. For every five successes past the first on her activation roll, the Scion may summon an additional elemental; alternatively, she may add 1 to her already-summoned elementals’ health and soaks, 3 to their damage, and 2 to their accuracy, speed, and DV. The elemental receives ten automatic successes to all physical feats or attacks and has the following abilities if unaugmented:

| Accuracy: 10 | Damage: 15 | Soaks: 15  |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Health: 15 | Speed: 20 | DV: 15 |

The elementals possess the same level 5 Fire Boon(s) as the Scion and need never pay for them, though they may only use them once per scene; if the Scion has activated the Devil Body Boon prior to summoning them, they receive the benefits of that Boon as well. In addition, the elementals may at any time take a two turn action to create a 10-foot-tall wall of fire wherever they walk; anyone passing through this wall suffers damage as if struck in combat by the elemental. Targets who are also skilled in the Fire purview have an additional soak versus the elemental’s attacks equal to the number of Fire Boons they possess, and may add the same amount to all damage when attacking the creature. At the end of the scene, the elemental reverts to the flame from whence it came.

### INFERNO ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult

The Scion with this Boon may call up consuming flames from nothing, filling an area with radius equal to his total number of Fire Boons in yards with an impromptu bonfire. Unlucky people or animals caught within the area must roll Dexterity + Athletics and overcome the Scion’s successes to attempt to escape; if they succeed, they dive out of the Scion’s affected area, and if they fail, they burn. The Scion may apply his total successes as dice of armor-ignoring lethal damage (the fire itself does a minimum of 5 dice of damage) done to creatures within his area, to extra yards of the area’s radius, or to a combination of the two. This Boon lasts for a number of minutes equal to the Scion’s total number of Fire Boons.

### PURIFYING FLAME ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3+ Legend and 1+ Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult

The Scion with this Boon may wield the frightening power of flame to purify and cleanse, ridding others of curses by burning the malevolence away. Whenever he wishes, he may attempt to burn away the effects of any malignant curse or effect placed upon a target by the Magic purview by paying the activation cost in addition to the spell’s cost; when he does so, he causes them to go up in a bonfire of roaring flames that strip the evil spell from their spirit. If he achieves more successes on his activation roll than the original placer of the curse did, the Scion may undo it; doing so completely removes the curse’s effects, but it also deals a number of levels of unsoakable aggravated damage to the Scion’s target equal to the level of the spell used to place the curse. This damage cannot be healed by magic, as it was incurred in a spiritual purification, and moreover the Scion’s target still suffers this damage if he attempts to rid them of a curse and fails. This Boon may only be used on willing targets, and can never be used in order to intentionally attack any being.

### BAELFYR ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Like the highly-stoked fires used to light ancient funeral pyres and send souls to the next world, the flames generated by the Scion with this Boon are preternaturally hot and hungry. Whenever the Scion activates a Fire Boon, he may pay the requisite cost to activate this one as well; if he does so, any damage dealt as a result of that Boon is considered aggravated instead of lethal.

### DEVIL BODY ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By turning her powers over flame inward, the Scion with this Boon turns into a creature of flame herself, becoming an unrecognizable burning replica of her former self with a roaring bonfire voice. Her touch causes a number of lethal health levels equal to her total number of Fire Boons to anyone who does not possess the Fire Immunity Boon (those who do take only a number of levels equal to the difference between her total number of Fire Boons and theirs) and she may climb any flammable surface with gravity-defying ease, just as if she were a flame herself; in addition, she gains an amount equal to her total Fire Boons to all her soaks. She may instantly use the Flame Travel Boon at any time (though she must still pay the Legend cost to do so), and may hurl her constituent flame as a projectile (via a Dexterity + Thrown roll) with range of 50 yards and lethal damage of 10 (those with Fire Immunity are immune to these attacks). Her flaming form remains until the end of the scene, when she reverts to normal.

### CONTROL FIRE ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion may create and control flames at will, wielding their destructive power with facile ease. He may control up to 10 cubic yards of flame, plus 10 more for each Legend he spends in excess of 5; he may order the fire to create walls or sections, destroy items, create signals, or even attack his enemies. If he successfully attacks a person or creature with the flame (this is a separate action from simply moving the flames around that requires him to spend this Boon’s activation cost again and roll his Wits + Command), he deals damage equal to his threshold successes (for each Legend point in excess of 5 he spent at activation, he may add another + 5 to this total), and the unlucky target continues to burn unless put out; for every action past the first, the target takes 5 less damage than he did the action before, until the flames finally burn themselves out (the total shrinks to 0). The flames themselves are resistant to being put out and are immune to all mundane water and ice, extinguishable only by supernatural forms of those elements. Others with the Control Fire Boon may attempt to wrest control from the Scion via a contested Wits + Command roll. This Boon lasts for the duration of the scene, after which point the fire will begin burning normally again, wherever it might be.

### IFRIT ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 5+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

The Scion’s mastery of flame has become so powerful that she may even confer it upon others. By channeling her flame into her willing human followers, causing them intense pain and irreversible burning damage, she may transform a number of worshipers equal to her total number of Fire Boons (and the same number again for every point of Legend she chooses to spend past the initial 5) into beings of living flame, granting them the benefits of the Devil Body Boon and a Legend pool equal to half her own. If she wishes to spend an additional 2 Legend per set of followers, she may also grant them the effects of the Halo of Fire Boon. The worshipers survive for a number of days equal to her successes, after which point they become mortal again and are consumed by the flames.

### FLAME BEAST ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend and 2 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

The Scion with this power may command the most untamable of fiery creatures, an enormous and mighty beast of uncontainable flame and destruction. A field of flame springs up around the Scion, out of which his chosen creature (each Scion should chose a unique creature to represent him upon purchasing this Boon, appropriate to his character and culture of origin) bursts to fulfill the Scion’s commands to the best of its abilities, giving him a gigantic engine of destruction poised at his command. The beast receives 20 automatic successes to all physical feats or attacks and has the following abilities:

| Accuracy: 20 | Damage: 30 | Soaks: 30  |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Health: 100 | Speed: 40 | DV: 20 |

The beast naturally possesses the Flame Travel and Halo of Fire Boons and need never pay for them; it also possesses the Dragon’s Breath Boon, which it may also use for free once every 2 turns (with a range of 9 yards). In addition, the beast may at any time take a 1 turn action to create a 10-foot-tall wall of fire wherever it passes; anyone passing through this wall suffers damage as if struck in combat by the beast. Targets who are also skilled in the Fire purview have an additional soak versus the beast’s attacks equal to the number of Fire Boons they possess, and may add the same amount to all damage when attacking the creature. At the end of the scene, the best dissolves into its constituent flame, leaving the Scion on his own once again.

### RAIN OF FIRE ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Survival

The very skies themselves rain down fire at the Scion’s command, causing burning bonfires (about the size of soccer balls) to fall unceasingly for the next ten minutes upon an area with radius equal to the Scion’s successes in miles (he has complete control over the rain and may choose to strike any area within this radius, and to spare any other that he does not wish to affect). Upon impact with the ground, the fireballs explode and instantly ignite five square yards in a radius around them. Those caught within the affected area must roll Dexterity + Athletics against the Scion’s successes each turn as they attempt to avoid the scathing rain, and suffer an amount of lethal damage equal to the Scion’s threshold successes added to his total number of Fire Boons if they fail. If the unfortunate target is not quenched, they continue to burn, taking 1 lethal damage every turn for a number of turns equal to five times half the Scion’s total number of Fire Boons.

### THE DEVOURER
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
