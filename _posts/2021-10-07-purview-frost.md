### FROST IMMUNITY ●
**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion is immune to the effects of cold and frost, at home in the most glacial of climates and conditions.

### GLACIAL RESISTANCE ●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By attuning aligning herself with the unyielding ice of winter, the Scion with this Boon may become likewise immovable. She may do this at any time by touching ice, frost or some frozen substance (this is a 2 turn action); once she has done so and paid the requisite cost, she may add twice her total number of Frost Boons as dice to the next Integrity roll she makes in this scene. This Boon does not stack with itself; it can be used to augment a specific roll only once.

### ULLER’S STRIDE ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

By creating a tiny layer of ice beneath his feet, the Scion may slide upon it at heightened speed, adding 5 yards to his movement speeds as long as he remains on a surface flat enough to support this mode of transportation. The Scion may not leave the ground with this effect except up to his normal jumping distance, but may use the slick trail of ice to give him additional momentum when jumping, adding 5 yards to his usual distance. The ice thus created melts instantly once the Scion leaves it, meaning that others may not follow behind him in the same manner, and ceases to be generated at the end of the scene.

### HRIMMTHURSSAR’S TOUCH ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion may channel cold into her very body, becoming hazardous to touch for others who might be susceptible to hypothermia or frostbite. Unprotected creatures and people suffer from penetrating, hypothermic cold when he touches them, and most plants die almost instantly, withered away by winter’s child. Any unarmed or melee attack she makes inflicts an additional number of damage dice equal to her total number of Frost Boons. Alternatively, the Scion may may freeze any small amount of water in seconds simply by touching it, and instantly freeze a large quantity of water (equal to her total number of Frost Boons in cubic yards) simply by touching it, for the price of an additional point of Legend. This Boon lasts the remainder of the scene, at which point she reverts to normal and becomes safe to touch again.

### SUMMON BARBEGAZI ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

By calling forth in a commanding manner, the Scion may summon snow gnomes to do her bidding. Upon being summoned, the barbegazi must be paid with their preferred price, a mug of hot cocoa (alternatively, they will accept a magical item – a trinket, relic, or trophy – or a lump-sum payment of 3 Legend per barbegazi; however, these alternatives become very expensive very quickly); if they are not paid, they will refuse to obey the Scion’s commands and may even intentionally cause mischief for her before vanishing again. The summoned barbegazi possess the Frost Immunity and Uller’s Stride Boons, and can work tirelessly at simple tasks (digging, cleaning, farming, etc.), though more complicated orders may pose difficulties. For every three successes she garners on her activation roll, the Scion may choose to either summon an additional barbegazi or to add one day to the time that they will remain to serve her. If no extra days are purchased with successes, the barbegazi depart in 24 hours.

### COOLING TEMPERS ●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma or Manipulation + Empathy

The Scion with this Boon extends his powers of temperance and freezing even to the human heart, cooling the hot passion of violence with a thought. When any person or creature acts in anger or violence, the Scion may spend the requisite cost to lay his coolness of spirit over them, rendering them unable to take any violent action or, indeed, think any violent thought for the rest of the scene (the exception to this is a target in Virtue Extremity, who cannot be calmed down via use of this Boon). The target may attempt to resist, and when doing so may add his or her total number of Fire and/or Chaos boons to the total results of the normal resist roll; if they fail and still wish to commit violent acts while in the Scion’s presence, they may once per minute spend a point of Willpower and roll their Willpower + Integrity in an attempt to overcome the Scion’s activation successes (this roll is cumulative). The Scion may never use this Boon on himself, and must handle his own temper the old-fashioned way.

### FROZEN PANOPLY ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per creation

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion may create ice sculptures and items out of thin air; he may use them as if they were normal, durable items, though they melt in a number of days equal to the Scion’s total number of Frost Boons and are too cold for those without the Frost Immunity Boon to touch without protection, dealing them one unsoakable lethal damage every turn that they remain in contact. The Scion may create gear equivalent to any of the armors or weapons found in Scion: Hero, but may not create anything with moving parts. The items thus created cannot be melted by conventional means, or by any heat source less mighty than lava or some Fire Boons.

### FROZEN FORTRESS ●●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Art (appropriate) + Frost

The Scion with this Boon may create an enduring fortress from his favored element, allowing him to safeguard himself or anyone else he wishes within walls of solid ice. For each success he scores on the activation roll, he may either create and shape two cubic yards of his fortress, or add one specific feature (i.e. a parapet, a bridge) to it; the finished product remains for a number of days equal to his total number of Frost Boons, regardless of the climate around it. At the end of that time, it becomes subject to the normal laws of nature, and will remain standing or melt depending upon the climate of the area in which it has been built.

### WINTER’S MERCY ●●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per person

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion may grant another person or creature the effects of the Frost Immunity Boon for a period of 24 hours, after which they return to their normal state.

### CHILL THE BLOOD ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Marksmanship

Difficulty: Target’s Stamina + Fortitude roll

The Scion with this Boon may freeze the very blood in his enemies’ veins, infusing them with pure, bitter cold. If she is successful, the target’s Dexterity is effectively lowered by 2 for the remainder of the scene; she may use this Boon on the same target more than once to continue lowering their Dexterity. If any target’s Dexterity is reduced to zero in this way, they are frozen and paralyzed for the remainder of the scene.

### FROSTBORN SPIRIT ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

When a Scion possesses this boon, her control over the glacial element is so great that she may summon up its very spirit to act on her behalf. Upon paying the requisite cost, the Scion summons a ten-foot-tall frost elemental of enormous strength and endurance which obeys her commands to the best of its ability. For every five successes past the first on her activation roll, the Scion may summon an additional elemental; alternatively, she may add 2 to her already-summoned elementals’ health and soaks, 2 to their damage, and 2 to their accuracy, speed, and DV. The elemental receives ten automatic successes to all physical feats or attacks and has the following abilities if unaugmented:

| Accuracy: 10 | Damage: 10 | Soaks: 20  |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Health: 20 | Speed: 20 | DV: 15 |

The elementals possess the Uller’s Stride and Hrimthurssar’s Touch Boons and need never pay for them. In addition, the elementals may at any time take a two turn action to create a glacial flash freeze in a fifteen-yard radius around them, covering the ground in a sheath of impenetrable ice; anyone without Frost Immunity caught within the area is iced over as well and suffers a -3 penalty to all rolls and movement speed as they try to fight off its effects. Targets who are also skilled in the Frost purview have an additional soak versus the elemental’s attacks equal to the number of Frost Boons they possess, and may add the same amount to all damage when attacking the creature. At the end of the scene, the elemental melts into the ground and vanishes.

### BLIZZARD CALL ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Survival

By calling on the ever-present powers of winter, the Scion may plunge an area equal to fifty times her total number of Frost Boons in square yards into sinking, freezing cold; the temperature immediately drops by a number of degrees Celsius equal to her successes every minute until it reaches zero, after which it drops the same amount every minute. Once the temperature has reached the freezing mark, the Scion may cause snow, sleet, or hail to fall, keep the temperature at a certain level of her choosing, cause snow avalanches or cracking crevasses in the earth, and inflict numbing cold on any targets of her wrath. If the Scion chooses to use this power in an area that already contains snow and ice, she may shape it with a thought to create objects or sculptures or even attack enemies with spikes of razor-sharp ice, inflicting damage equal to twice her total number of Frost Boons. If two Scions attempt to take control of the same area of cold and ice, they must roll against one another every minute, with the winner receiving the ability to direct things until the next roll. At the end of the scene the temperature begins to rise back to its normal level, though it takes an amount of time to do so equal to the amount of time it took it to sink to the Scion’s preferred level. Alternatively, the Scion may use this Boon to raise the temperature of an already freezing area, changing the biting cold to that of a pleasant (if slightly chilly) autumn day.

### FROZEN HEART ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 4 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy

The Scion with this Boon has powers of frigidity so great that he may dull the courage of even the boldest of warriors. By overcoming a target’s resistance, he buries their drives and morale, lowering their willpower and virtue ratings; he may lower any opponent’s virtue score by one for each threshold success he nets, or render them completely unable to spend Willpower by scoring threshold successes equal to twice the target’s total Willpower rating. The target remains thus quelled for a number of turns equal to the Scion’s total number of Frost Boons, after which his or her virtues and willpower will reassert themselves with a vengeance; if the Scion’s target has any virtue reduced to zero AND is rendered unable to spend Willpower, they must roll that virtue when this Boon ceases to take effect and immediately enter Virtue Extremity if they score any successes.

### FROZEN SOUL ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Integrity

By internalizing his affinity with the most immovable element, the Scion with this Boon may freeze his own passions and emotions, even his own mind, rendering him extraordinarily difficult to influence or manipulate. Once he has paid the requisite amount of Legend and Willpower, the Scion insulates his heart and mind behind a sheet of ephemeral ice; he may add his successes on the activation roll as dice to any resistance roll against a mind- or emotion-altering power being used on him, a benefit that remains for the next 24 hours. However, dampening his own emotions does deny him the use of them for his own purposes; the Scion may not channel any Virtues during this time and automatically fails all Virtue rolls he undertakes. Once this Boon’s effects have worn off, the Scion must immediately roll a random one of his Virtues, adding his total number of Frost Boons as extra dice; if he scores more successes than he possesses total points of Willpower, he immediately enters Virtue Extremity, which lasts for twice as long as it would normally.

### FLASH FREEZE ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Survivalillusion pur

Difficulty: Target’s Stamina dots + Fortitude dots (no Epic Stamina)

Unconstrained by the usual laws of nature, the Scion may cause an intense, sudden burst of cold to radiate outward from herself, freezing an unlucky target solid. The Scion inflicts a number of levels of unsoakable bashing damage equal to her total number of Frost Boons + her threshold successes, giving her the power to instantly drop or even kill opponents. If a target wishes to attempt to resist this Boon, they must spend 5 Legend and 1 Willpower to attempt to roll their Stamina + Survival and overcome the Scion’s successes; those who are unable to resist the Scion’s will and are frozen to their bones may be shattered like ice sculptures by the merest well-placed blow.

### FROST BEAST ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend and 2 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

The Scion with this power may command the most implacable of winter’s creatures, a great monster of snow and ice. A thick sheath of ice radiates outward from the Scion, freezing the ground, out of which a massive frozen beast bursts to fulfill the Scion’s commands to the best of its abilities, giving him a gigantic force of nature poised at his command. The beast receives 20 automatic successes to all physical feats or attacks and has the following abilities:

| Accuracy: 22 | Damage: 22 | Soaks: 42  |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Health: 130 | Speed: 42 | DV: 17 |

The beast naturally possesses the Blizzard Call, Uller’s Stride and Hrimthurssar’s Touch Boons and need never pay for them; it also possesses the Chill the Blood Boon, which it may also use for free once every 2 turns. In addition, the beast may at any time take a two turn action to create a glacial flash freeze in a fifteen-yard radius around it, covering the ground in a sheath of impenetrable ice; anyone without Frost Immunity caught within the area is iced over as well and suffers a -3 penalty to all rolls and movement speed as they try to fight off its effects. Targets who are also skilled in the Frost purview have an additional soak versus the beast’s attacks equal to the number of Frost Boons they possess, and may add the same amount to all damage when attacking the creature (this bonus may be circumvented if the Scion who summons the Firedrake does so with the Subzero Boon). At the end of the scene, the beast returns from whence it came, leaving the Scion on his own once again.

### YMIR’S HAND ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Survival

Through sheer force of will, the Scion settles glacial cold over an area with a radius equal to his total number of Frost Boons in miles, plus one additional mile for each success he scores on his activation roll. Every being caught within the affected zone is afflicted as if they had been the target of the Chill the Blood Boon unless they remain near a source of warmth. The effects of the Boon remain for a number of days equal to the Scion’s successes plus 1, during which time the Scion is lord of the frozen waste he has created; his Frost Boons no longer require him to spend any points of Willpower, and he need only pay half their normal Legend cost to activate them. Potential rivals attempting to use the Frost purview within this area must overcome his activation successes or discover, to their dismay, that he suddenly controls their Boon’s effect.

### THE COLD
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion becomes the embodiment of cold, freezing and cracking all in his path.
