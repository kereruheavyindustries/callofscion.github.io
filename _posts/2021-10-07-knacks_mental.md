### BROAD-SPECTRUM RECEPTION
Prerequisite: Spatial Attunement

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack can extend her senses far beyond the normal pale of humanity. By spending the requisite cost, she opens her awareness to those sensations normally noticeable only by machines and sensitive animals; she gains the ability to see in the infrared and ultraviolet spectrums, can see and feel magnetic fields and radioactive decay, and can even detect the movement of radio and television waves around her, though she cannot listen in on them. She may tune into only one of these extended senses at a time, but may switch freely between them at any time throughout the scene.

### CLAIRVOYANCE
Prerequisite: Telescopic Senses

**Cost:** 3+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Only the most sensitive of Scions have the power of this Knack, which allows them to extend their senses to places completely outside their range. By spending the requisite amount, a Scion may eavesdrop on any place that he has been before, seeing, hearing and smelling the scene as if he were there while his body remains miles away. He may choose to feel and taste anything within his line of sight as well if he wishes to pay the Legend cost a second time. the Scion cannot directly interact with anything at his chosen scene, as he is not actually there; he is merely an observer. If the Scion chooses to project himself to a place on a different plane (such as viewing a pub in Ireland from the Underworld), he must spend 5 Legend instead of 3 to force his consciousness past the boundaries of the realms.

### CRACK SHOT
Prerequisite: Eagle-Eyed

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has honed her skills in aiming so finely that she can shoot across distances completely impossible for even the most well-trained of mortals. Whenever she chooses to pay the requisite cost, she may for the rest of the scene use any non-thrown ranged weapon to shoot up to ten times as far as the weapon’s range would normally allow it to without penalty (assuming, of course, that she can see that far).

### DIVINE MARKSMAN
Prerequisite: Crack Shot

**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Foes are wise to fear the Scion with this Knack, who is able to shoot with such astonishing range and accuracy that his missiles seem to come from nowhere, raining down from the heavens or darting divinely across the planet. For the scene in which he activates this Knack, the Scion may shoot a non-thrown weapon as far as he is able to see with no penalty for range and regardless of his weapon’s usual limitations (though obstacles that impede his perceptions may still cause him trouble).

### EAGLE-EYED
Prerequisite: Sharpshooter

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Even mortal-made machines can be affected by the divine ichor in a Scion’s veins, and a Scion with this knack may now add her Epic Perception auto-successes to her damage roll for the rest of the scene when attacking with a firearm. Scions who use more traditional weapons may also benefit from the uncanny sharpness that this knack lends to their vision; whenever she shoots a bow or other ranged weapon that would normally use her Strength to deal damage, she may pay one point of Legend to instead use her Perception.

### EMPATH
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has an uncanny ability to recognize and understand the complex emotions and responses of others around her, rendering her able to read their distress, respond to their unspoken questions, or even manipulate them if the need arises. She may count her dots in Empathy as automatic successes instead of dice in any roll; if she wishes to pay a cost of one point of Legend, she may also count her dots in Arete: Empathy or any bonuses she might have to Empathy from Geasa.

### ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
Prerequisite: Subliminal Warning

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is totally attuned to his surroundings, able to detect the slightest change or irregularity with unconscious ease. He has an innate sense of the passage of time, and immediately registers any changes in pressure, temperature, the ground beneath his feet or the environment surrounding him, as long as he is awake. He is extremely difficult to surprise and may always roll to notice an ambush a full turn before it occurs, potentially giving him time to take preparatory actions or alert his comrades; even if he does not notice it ahead of time, he joins battles immediately with the first person to act when an attack is made.

### EYES IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD
Prerequisite: Subliminal Warning

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

This knack represents a Scion whose abilities when it comes to detection are just uncanny, and who demonstrates an unearthly ability to always know exactly what’s going on around him. The experience cost for him to learn the Awareness, Empathy, Investigation and Stealth abilities is halved.

### FOOL ME ONCE…
Prerequisite: Empath

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is an old hand at recognizing flim-flammery. She immediately sees through all illusions created by beings with fewer levels of Illusion than she has dots of Epic Perception, able to instantly see through their false seemings and identify them as what they truly are. In addition, she may even recognize the illusion’s creator simply by looking at his or her handiwork, provided that she has seen an illusion crafted by that person before.

### HEAR PRAYERS
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

As the Scion with this Knack reaches true divinity, he may act as a god in truth, hearing the pleas of his worshipers. No matter where he might be, he automatically hears spoken prayers addressed to him and gains a general sense of the supplicant’s location; if more than one person prays to him at the same time, he experiences the prayers as if all were being spoken at the same time, potentially making them difficult to sort out.

This Knack may only be possessed by Scions with a Legend rating of 9 or higher.

### IN YOUR DREAMS
Prerequisite: Environmental Awareness

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Even in the realm of sleep, the Scion with this Knack is not caught unawares. Where most sleepers are dead to the world until they awake, the Scion’s senses operate as fully as they do when wakeful, and she is aware of and able to recall anything that occurs in her vicinity while she is asleep. If she wishes to awaken and deal with any action occurring around her, she may do so at any time unless she is exhausted, in which case she must roll as normal for attempting to stave off exhaustion.

### PARALLEL ATTENTION
Prerequisite: Eyes in the Back of Your Head

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Being overwhelmed by excess stimuli is a real problem for many people, even those who don’t have enhanced senses, but the Scion with this Knack breezes past these concerns with ease. No matter how many things are going on our how many sources of input are clamoring for her attention, she may easily deal with all of them, perfectly distinguishing one from another and suffering no distraction penalties from doing so for the remainder of the scene.

### PERFECT PITCH
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has a complete ability to distinguish between the slightest differences and shades in tone. He knows the difference between various kinds of sounds instantly, even if the variation is so minute that even a computer might not pick it up, and can distinguish between different tones and notes with infinitesimally small differences.

### PREDATORY FOCUS
Prerequisite: Subliminal Warning

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is the world’s most efficient bloodhound, able to follow a trail with astonishing speed and accuracy. She may track her quarry at her full movement speed instead of the normal half speed, as she can identify the signs of its passage so quickly that there is no need to slow down and search more thoroughly.

### ELECTROMAGNETIC PERCEPTION
Prerequisite: Broad-Spectrum Reception

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has a permanently altered awareness that allows him full access to ranges of communication usually reserved only for machines. He now gains all the effects of the Broad-Spectrum Reception knack at all times without having to pay for them, and when he activates this Knack he also gains the ability to actually tune into radio, television and radar waves, reading their content as if he were listening or watching at their destination.

### REAL MCCOY
Prerequisite: Fool Me Once…

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

While illusions are false by nature, it can be trickier to spot those who actually change their shape. Upon spending the requisite cost, the Scion with this Knack may for the rest of the scene instinctively recognize any being that is shapechanged or physically altered from its original form, whether this was accomplished via plastic surgery, Epic Appearance Knacks, the Animal, Health or Magic purviews, or any other means of altering a being’s form. The Scion is not necessarily able to suss out what the person’s original form might have been, but she knows that this isn’t it.

### REFINED PALATE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has a sense of smell and taste second to none. He can separate the ingredients in a dish of food or the components of a chemical compound with just one sniff, and taste even the subtlest of flavorings. He instantly tastes and poison or harmful substance added to his food, and likewise knows the moment harmful gases are introduced into the air; he can even pinpoint the origin of some of a dish’s ingredients with decent accuracy, able to detect the trace tastes of the environment from which they came.

### SELECTIVE PALATE
Prerequisite: Refined Palate

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Some Scions can pull off truly heroic feats of eating, while others just want to get through the next state dinner, but there’s one thing they all have in common: when something tastes bad, it tastes bad. A Scion with this knack, on the other hand, may rewire or switch his tastebuds off any time, rendering raw sewage the same flavor as fresh strawberries or even as nothing at all. He is never required to roll Stamina + Fortitude in order to avoid vomiting from ingesting rotten or unappetizing items. This ability to tackle any kind of meal anywhere has more than a little ability to impress and astound, and has saved more than one Scion faced with a diplomatic peace-offering of a twitching, foul-smelling carcass from losing face (and his lunch).

### SENSE INVOCATION
Prerequisite: Hear Prayers

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

A god in truth, the Scion with this Knack knows when his name is invoked, whether by devout worshipers, shouted by determined evangelists or whispered secretly by his enemies. Whenever anyone speaks his name, the Scion hears it and immediately knows exactly where the speaker is, though he does not necessarily know who spoke unless he chooses to travel there or use other means of looking in on the situation. What constitutes a true name of the Scion is up to Storyteller discretion, but any name under which he is worshiped or commonly known may be a possibility.

### SHARPSHOOTER
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend 

**Dice Pool:** None

The old, traditional pantheon gods may feel that guns and other newfangled firearms are a trifling matter, but many up-and-coming Scions are very attached to their toys and have found ways around their normal limitations. The Scion with this knack has made a study of knowing exactly where to aim to cause the most damage, and consequently may add her Epic Perception to her damage rolls when using guns.

### SPATIAL ATTUNEMENT
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Like a bat or whale, the Scion with this Knack may activate it in order to gain invisible sonar-like abilities, enabling him to “see” and make his way around even in pitch darkness. He takes no penalties for blindfighting or navigating in dark areas for the remainder of the scene, and may “map out” any room within seconds of entering it.

### SUBLIMINAL WARNING
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is preternaturally attuned to danger, and feels a tingle of warning a split second before an attack or disaster strikes her unawares. She does not know a particular danger’s exact nature, nor is she alerted to it in time to warn anyone else, but she may have just enough time to take an action of her own.

### SUBVOCALIZATION
Prerequisite: Perfect Pitch

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Having mastered the near-infinite shades of tonal variety and pitch, the Scion can now pick and choose among them when communicating. If she so wishes, she may choose a level of Epic Perception and speak so quietly that only another person who can equal or exceed that level of Epic Perception can hear her. Note that while she can choose any level of Epic Perception that she possesses to be the target sound level, she cannot speak more softly than she herself could hear.

### SUPERNAL HUNTER
Prerequisite: Predatory Focus

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is unshakable from his trail, the epitome of the inescapable and relentless hunter; he can follow machines, creatures of the air and fishes of the sea as easily as if they left footprints for him to trace. As long he continues to track the same quarry, he may do so even if it takes normally insurmountable evasive action, such as flight or teleportation.

### TELESCOPIC SENSES
Prerequisite: Spatial Attunement

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has no need for telescopes or radar; he is literally able to see, hear, and otherwise perceive for huge distances if he chooses, multiplying his perceptions beyond all human bounds. He may distinguish any sensations happening within his earshot as if they were occurring right in front of his nose, and see and hear in a much larger range than any human (and many gods), able to keep track of events happening up to ten times further away from him than he would otherwise be able to. If he chooses, he may deactivate this Knack at no cost to avoid sensory overload, and reactivate it later at no cost.

### UNFAILING RECOGNITION
Prerequisite: Real McCoy

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Investigation

Disguises simply and utterly fail to fool the Scion with this Knack, who never forgets a face (or what’s underneath it). She immediately recognizes any person that she has met and to whom she is Fatebound, no matter what lengths have been gone to to disguise them – they could be melted into a puddle of living goo and she would still know them on sight. Whenever she is confronted by a being that she suspects may be other than it is purporting to be, the Scion may spend a point of Legend to roll against the Manipulation + Empathy of whomever has done the concealing; if successful, she instantly sees her target’s true form and knows exactly what was done to change them into the seeming they currently wear. This Knack applies to all uses of the Illusion purview and all forms of shapeshifting, and may also see through any other kind of supernatural concealment (Sacred Image, possession with the Ori purview, etc.).

### I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE
Prerequisite: Empath

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion’s incredible powers of observation and instinct for identifying mannerisms and tells allow her to identify the subtle change in demeanor of someone attempting to use mind-affecting abilities upon her. She may add her dots in Perception to her MDV. This Knack may only stack with two other Tier 2 resistance Knacks.

### AUDIT SELF
Prerequisite: I See What You Did There

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:**

While observant Scions are , it takes an especially sharp awareness to be able to observe and catalog anomalies to one’s own thought processes and reactions. He may use his automatic successes in Epic Perception instead of Legend when calculating MDV. This Knack does not stack with Untouchable Presence, Weaver of Webs, Disorienting Countenance, Parapet of the Mind, or Crazy Like a Fox.

### APPLIED ACADEMICS
Prerequisite: Perfect Memory

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Well-versed in the lore of every book to come his way, the Scion with this Knack can go beyond mere study and apply his book-learning to real-life situations. He may add his dots of Academics as dice to any Empathy, Occult or Politics rolls. Scions with Arete: Academics may pay an additional point of Legend to add these as well if they have 1-5 dots of it, an additional two points of Legend if they have 6-8, and an additional three points of Legend if they want to add Arete: Academics of 9 or more to their roll.

### ART OF WAR
Prerequisite: Fight With Your Head

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Command

The Scion with this Knack can calculate every angle and possibility in a coming battle so finely that she gives her troops an extra edge over those laboring under less skilled commanders. Whenever she knows that a battle is coming and chooses to use this Knack, she may add every success she gains to a pool of dice; in the conflict to come, she may then parcel out these dice to her companions’ actions whenever she chooses, commanding them with perfect precision to bring out the best in them. She may never give any one ally more dice to a single action than she possesses dots of Epic Intelligence, however, and moreover may not grant more dice to a single action than her target possesses dots of normal Intelligence (as she can only do so much with the truly dull-minded). Once she runs out of dice, the Scion may choose to use this Knack again, but doing so is a 10-tick action.

### AXIOM
Prerequisite: Applied Academics

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Related ability

The Scion with this Knack is so intelligent that even when she doesn’t quite know the answer, she knows the answer. Whenever the Scion observes a phenomenon or scenario happen exactly the same three times in a row, she may pay the requisite cost and make a pronouncement about the way that scenario works (i.e., “Whenever it rains over the old barn, golden lilypads appear in the pond.”). When she does so, she rolls a dice pool appropriate to the situation at hand; the difficulty is variable, based upon the Legend ratings of those involved and the specificity of her claim. If she garners 10 successes, she may accurately explain the doings of mortal phenomena; if she gains 30 successes she may explain the behavior of lesser immortals, Legendary beings and magical phenomena, and with 50 or more successes she may even explain the behavior of the gods and Overworlds. The Storyteller then informs her, if she is successful, either that her statement is true (meaning that it will always be true, and there will always be golden lilypads when it rains) or that it is false, meaning she has overlooked some detail that ruins the pattern. From that point forward, her successfully-made statement is the truth, whether or not it originally was.

### BLOCKADE OF REASON
Prerequisite: Telepathy

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The strength of her indomitable intellect allows the Scion with this Knack to resist the mind-altering effects of others, giving her a better chance of escaping their manipulations than a more feeble-minded victim might have. She may add her dots in Intelligence as dice to all resist rolls.

### CIPHER
Prerequisite: Math Genius

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Capable of lateral thinking on an epic scale, the Scion with this Knack can solve any puzzle and break any code, deciphering the complex secrets of any conundrum with ease. She automatically solves any mortal-made code, puzzle or encryption she encounters, and may apply her intelligence in reverse to create uncrackable codes of her own, completely unsolvable by anyone who does not also possess this Knack.

### COMPARTMENTALIZATION
Prerequisite: Applied Academics

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

So great is the Scion’s control over his mind that he can split tiny fragments of it off with this Knack, hiding his memories away so deeply that even he cannot find them. Whenever he chooses, he may pay the requisite cost and name one fact he currently knows; once he has done so, he immediately and irretrievably forgets it, behaving as if he had never learned it in the first place. He does not remember ever having been told the information, and even if he is taught it again he will forget it within 24 hours of learning it. When the Scion hides information from himself, he must choose one triggering event (as mundane as “when I go to bed tonight” or as specific as “when Odin says the following word”); whenever that triggering event occurs, no matter how long it might be after this Knack was used, the Scion instantly remembers the forgotten piece of information.

Should something occur that wipes the Scion’s memory (Chaos Boons, Appearance Knacks or the influence of the Drowned Road, for example), any memories hidden with this Knack remain safe and return as normal when triggered, even if they were originally gained during the time that the Scion has lost.

### CONCEPT TO EXECUTION
Prerequisite: Fast Learner

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack possesses the brainpower necessary not only to understand and theorize when it comes to gadgetry, but to improvise and create on a level seen only in science fiction. By spending an appropriate amount of time planning and creating, the Scion gains the ability to create relics and magical items, even if she does not have the Artistry purview.

### FAST LEARNER
Prerequisite: Well-Read Virgin

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

There is no intellectual trial that the Scion with this Knack cannot learn to master and no academic discipline that he shies away from. The experience cost for him to learn the Academics, Medicine, Occult and Politics abilities is halved.

### FIGHT WITH YOUR HEAD
Prerequisite: Principles of Motion

**Cost:** 1-3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack can find the chinks in her opponent’s armor at a glance, not only identifying their weaknesses but also learning instinctively how to exploit them. When faced with an opponent, the Scion may choose any one of their attributes (with the exception of Intelligence) to reduce, subtracting a number of dice or successes equal to her Epic Intelligence successes from any roll they choose to make against her or any derived value such as soak or DV as a 10-tick action. She may only reduce one attribute thusly at a time, and is the only one to reap the benefits; she is merely exploiting her opponent through astute thinking and cannot actually reduce their dots in any attribute.

If the Scion has 1-5 dots of Epic Intelligence, she need pay only one point of Legend for this Knack; if she has 6-8, it costs two points of Legend, and if she has 9 or more it costs the full three points.

### GRANT VISIONS
Prerequisite: Telepathy

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

No longer restricted to mere short bursts of words, the Scion with this Knack may send images and landscapes directly into her targets’ minds if she so chooses, sharing a wealth of information in a single instant. She may telepathically send any one image (whether a simple one, such as an apple, or a complicated one, such as the interior of the feasting hall of Valhalla) to her target upon paying this Knack’s cost.

### KNOW-IT-ALL
Prerequisite: Speed Reader

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is a wellspring of the bizarre, the obscure, and the arcane. She knows random bits of trivia on every subject under the sun. Whenever she chooses to pay the requisite cost, she gains phantom dots equal to her Epic Intelligence dots in Academics, Command, Investigation, Medicine, Occult, Politics or Survival for the remainder of the scene as she calls upon her vast stores of book-learned knowledge; these dots function exactly like real ones, including allowing her the use of her Epic Attributes, but vanish at the end of the scene. If she already possesses any dots in that ability, this Knack does nothing.

### MATH GENIUS
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

No matter the circumstances or the difficulty of the problem, the Scion with this Knack is able to perform extraordinary feats of calculation on the fly. He needs no pencil or paper and need not spend an extended period of time considering any but the most mind-bending of mathematics; estimations, calculations, and other numerical permutations are solved for him almost instantaneously.

### MIND TETHER
Prerequisite: Grant Visions

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By concentrating and binding their minds together as one, the Scion may briefly commune more easily and fully with her target, sharing thoughts as she chooses with no restrictions on time or detail. When she pays this Knack’s cost, the Scion gains the ability to directly communicate with her target as if using the Telepathy Knack for the rest of the scene and need not pay for each individual thought. If she wishes to spend an additional three points of Legend, she may also freely share images and visions as if using the Grant Visions Knack.

### MULTI-TASKING
Prerequisite: Parapet of the Mind

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Even the most astute of thinkers can be overwhelmed when trying to do too many things at once, but for the Scion with this Knack, juggling jobs is a breeze. She may easily perform any number of mental actions (up to a maximum of her total number of Epic Intelligence dots) simultaneously, giving her the potential to solve a knotty math problem, work on a symphonic composition, give a lecture on nuclear physics and sketch out a blueprint for an ambitious new building, all while driving to work with the other hand. This Knack may be used for any mental or social action, including such esoteric ones as the activation of Boons or Knacks.

### PARAPET OF THE MIND
Prerequisite: Blockade of Reason

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Some Titans and Gods (and some of their spawn) have developed partial immunity even to the amazing effects of a Scion’s strategizing abilities, but that is not to say that they are completely free of their influence. For the price of one point of Legend plus the cost of the power being used against him (as well as one more for every dot of Epic Intelligence the attacker has over the Scion), he may remove his Legend from his resistance roll and instead add his Epic Intelligence auto-successes to his total (though, since this is a function of her incredible mental faculties and not her reaction time or appearance, this Knack cannot be combined with Disorienting Countenance or Crazy Like a Fox).

### PERFECT MEMORY
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has a memory that goes beyond the photographic to the completely eidetic. Any detail, no matter how small or inconsequential, may be remembered with perfect clarity if she noticed it, no matter how long ago a scene occurred or what else she might have been doing since. She remembers everything with crystal clarity and need never fear forgetting a vital piece of information.

### PRINCIPLES OF MOTION
Prerequisite: Tactical Planning

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Through his grasp of the principles of motion and violence and his extensive studying on the subject, the Scion with this Knack can brawl with the best of them on the strength of theoretical learning alone. He may add his Academics dots as dice to any Brawl, Marksmanship, Melee or Thrown rolls. Scions with Arete: Academics may pay an additional point of Legend to add these as well if they have 1-5 dots of it, an additional two points of Legend if they have 6-8, and an additional three points of Legend if they want to add Arete: Academics of 9 or more to their roll.

### REFUGE IN LOGIC
Prerequisite: Cipher

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Sometimes the greatest strength of a Scion’s mind lies in refusing to accept the unacceptable. By taking a step back to logically examine a situation (in combat, this is a 10-tick action), the Scion may once per day arrive at an acceptable conclusion, and the resulting renewal of understanding and determination replenishes one point of her Willpower for every dot of Epic Intelligence that she possesses.

### REMOTE CONTROL
Prerequisite: Wireless Interface

**Cost:** 1 Legend per machine

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion is so easily able to visualize the inner workings of machinery and circuitry that he can manipulate them with the power of her mind alone. In addition to the benefits of Wireless Interface, he may remotely operate any one other piece of machinery he can see as though doing so in person, potentially becoming able to operate a microwave, a sewing machine and a wrecking ball all from the comfort of his windowseat. He may control only one machine at a time, but may choose to abandon one and pay for another at any time; all machines, however, must be powered in some way (whether via electricity, steam or magical juice) in order to respond to his commands.

### SPEED READER
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack processes at a superhuman speed, rendering him able to digest the written word hundreds of times more quickly than his compatriots. He may completely and thoroughly read up to five pages of text per second for every dot of Epic Intelligence he possesses.

### STAR PUPIL
Prerequisite: Well-Read Virgin

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Having moved beyond the mere theoretical, the Scion with this Knack is able to apply her knowledge in concrete and physical ways. The experience cost for her to learn the Athletics, Brawl, Control, Larceny, Marksmanship, Melee and Thrown abilities is halved.

### TACTICAL PLANNING
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack proceeds into combat on the strength of his intelligence and ability to plan alone, rather than relying on the crutch of reflexes. He may substitute his Intelligence for his Wits when rolling to Join Battle (unless he is successfully surprised).

### TEACHING PRODIGY
Prerequisite: Star Pupil

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Not only a whiz on her own but also an accomplished teacher, the Scion with this Knack may pass her expertise on through tutoring and lecturing, helping her students to make the necessary leaps of logic, intuition, and understanding to fully grasp the material. If she actively teaches an ability to another person (for an entire day if they are Legendary, or for a consecutive week of entire days if they are mortal) who possesses fewer dots in it than she does, they may purchase it at half of its usual experience point cost.

### TELEPATHY
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

As adept mentally as some are physically, the Scion with this Knack may eschew audible conversation entirely and may send thoughts straight into the head of any target she can see, speaking to them entirely mentally. He may send only one sentence or complete thought per point of Legend spent.

### VECTOR
Prerequisite: Cipher

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Marksmanship

The Scion with this Knack has an incredibly keen eye for angles and an acuity and precision only dreamed of by most. Whenever she uses a power or levels an attack that might hit multiple targets – a spray of machine-gun fire, a lobbed fireball, etc. – she may exempt a number of targets equal to her successes from being struck; she guides her missiles so expertly that they skim by the ears and ankles of her friends harmlessly.

### WELL-READ VIRGIN
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

While most people find themselves unable to truly apply their intelligence to a problem that falls outside their area of expertise, the Scion with this Knack has studied so extensively that there is no area in which he is not an expert. He may always add his successes from Epic Intelligence to any roll made with the aim of gathering information, even if he possesses no dots in the ability being rolled.

### WIRELESS INTERFACE
Prerequisite: Telepathy

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Academics

The Scion with this Knack is able to tap into the minds of any and all computers around her, manipulating them even if she does not physically touching them. She may mentally operate any computer or other sophisticated electronic device that she can see without touching it, tapping straight into its operating systems to bypass the need for things like keyboards and physical input. She suffers from a 2-dice distraction penalty while doing so if anything else is going on around her.

### ADAPTIVE FIGHTING
Prerequisite: Master-at-Arms

**Cost:** 1-3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack can miss, but she rarely misses twice. Capable of adjusting her moves on the fly in combat and reacting to the fighting styles and actions of others, she exponentially increases her chances of success by tailoring her moves to her opponent’s; when she misses an attack, she may pay the Legend cost to add bonus dice equal to her successes from Epic Wits to her next attack on the same target. Scions with 1 to 5 dots of Epic Wits pay only one point of Legend to use this Knack; those with 6 to 8 pay two points and those with 9 to 10 pay the full three points to add their total number of dots of Epic Wits.

### BETWEEN THE TICKS
Prerequisite: Opening Gambit

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

With unheard-of lightning reflexes, the Scion with this Knack may not only act before her opponents can react but again afterward, bewildering and disarming attackers before they realize what has happened. Once per scene, the Scion may pay the requisite cost reflexively; when she does so, she may act during the enemies turn.

### BORN BEHIND THE WHEEL
Prerequisite: Stunt Driver

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this knack is simply among the most talented stuntmen on the planet, no matter what kind of driving he chooses. The Scion gains permanent free dots in the Control ability equal to his Epic Wits and may distribute them as he likes among his Controls (though he may not apply them to the Control that he already has the most dots in); he may also double the dice he rolls from Control in any applicable situation, up to a maximum of his highest Control skill.

### CHARIOTS OF FIRE
Prerequisite: Born Behind the Wheel

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By finding just the right drafts of air, decreasing resistance and sliding through the elements with utmost professionalism, the Scion with this Knack may push even mundane vehicles to heights of speed they were never meant to reach. Whenever she pays the requisite cost, the vehicle she is currently controlling increases its speed by 20% for every dot of Epic Wits she possesses, allowing her to scream across the sky, zoom down a highway or plow through the ocean spray at unheard-of speeds.

### COBRA REFLEXES
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Quicker on the draw than the fastest snake, the Scion with this Knack can be surprised by her opponents, but woe betide the attacker who ambushes her ill-prepared. Whenever she is successfully surprised with an attack, the Scion may immediately and automatically strike her attacker back at 0 DV on the same tick, regardless of when she would normally act.

### CRAZY LIKE A FOX
Prerequisite: Lateral Thinking

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Some Titans and Gods (and some of their spawn) have developed the ability to respond partially even to the amazing gymnastics of a Scion’s Epic Wits, but that is not to say that they are completely free of its influence. For the price of one point of Legend plus the cost of the power being used on him (plus one more for every dot of Epic Wits the attacker has over the Scion), he may remove his Legend from his resistance roll and instead add his Epic Wits auto-successes to his total (though, since this is a function of his ability to think on his feet and not his appearance or analysis skills, this Knack cannot be combined with Parapet of the Mind or Disorienting Countenance).

### DAMAGE CONTROL
Prerequisite: Psychic Profiler

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Politics

The smoothest and most carefully controlled of negotiations can be destroyed by one careless word or thoughtless insult, but only if the Scion with this Knack is not on hand to prevent it. Whenever anyone around her makes a serious faux pas, she may pay the requisite cost to roll against the offended party’s Perception + Politics; if she is successful, she may fully distract them from the disastrous incident via witty asides, adroit misdirection and quick thinking, causing them to completely ignore anyone but herself for a number of seconds equal to her threshold successes. Of course, this does not prevent anyone else from making further mistakes (or, indeed, from continuing to make the same mistake in the background), but it may give the Scion time to smooth things over or silence the offender with a well-placed stomp to his instep.

### DON’T READ THE MANUAL
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

A born driver of every vehicle under the sun, the Scion may pay the requisite cost to act as if he had one point in any Control he might need, even if he has never attempted to fly an ornithopter or pilot a spaceship before. This knack has no effect if he already has a dot in that Control.

### ETERNAL VIGILANCE
Prerequisite: Instant Investigator

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is a tense-strung bow, constantly at the ready for anything no matter what else is going on. Whenever he would be surprised or ambushed by an attacker, he may roll Wits + Survival (if out in the field) or Wits + Politics (if in a more convivial setting) instead of Perception + Awareness to notice the incoming threat. While the Scion himself is nigh-impossible to surprise, he has only enough time to respond to the threat and cannot warn anyone else if a fight is about to break out.

### EVASIVE ACTION
Prerequisite: Rabbit Reflexes

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

A master of elusion with an uncanny ability to know what’s coming next, the Scion with this Knack seldom finds herself pinned down by widespread attacks. Whenever she would be affected by an attack that covers a wide area and would normally roll Dexterity + Athletics to evade it, she may instead roll Wits + Awareness, predicting its spread with instant, honed instincts.

### INGENIOUS IMPROVISER
Prerequisite: Cobra Reflexes

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

For the Scion with this Knack, anything to hand becomes a potential source of destructive force when the chips are down. Once per scene, he may double his dice from Melee or Thrown when using an improvised weapon for the first time, enabling him to utterly destroy foes with a folding chair or battered teapot as easily as he might with a sword.

### INSTANT ASSESSMENT
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By looking her opponent up and down, the Scion with this Knack instantly pegs them as a superior or inferior enemy. She may instantly learn an opponent’s Epic Strength or Epic Perception (whichever they use to deal damage) totals and what their soaks and DV are. This power may be activated reflexively and does not require an action.

### INSTANT INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisite: Instant Assessment

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Investigation

The Scion with this Knack can smell foul play with uncanny accuracy. When he inspects the scene of a crime and overcomes a difficulty equal to the number of days since the crime occurred, he learns one of the following for every threshold success: the nature of the crime, the number of perpetrators involved and a rough play-by-play of what probably happened, including identifying any attempts made to cover it up and how long ago it happened. If more than one crime happened during the time period that his roll allows him to investigate, he learns the details of the most recent crime and then works his way backward. He cannot find out specific names or motives, but he can glean more than enough information for further investigation.

### JACK OF ALL TRADES
Prerequisite: Meditative Focus

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is a born improviser. If she attempts to make a roll to perform any action using the Animal Ken, Art, Athletics, Brawl, Larceny, Marksmanship, Melee, Stealth or Thrown ability, she may spend the requisite cost to proceed as if she had dots equal to her Epic Wits dots in that ability, including allowing her the use of her Epic Attributes, until the end of the scene. If she already possesses any dots in that ability, this Knack does nothing.

### LAST WORD
Prerequisite: Scathing Retort

**Cost:** 2 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Politics

There is no overcoming the blistering scorn of the Scion with this Knack; when he shuts someone down in conversation, they stay shut down. Whenever the Opening Salvo or Scathing Retort Knack has been used (by anyone, not necessarily by the Scion himself), he may level this Knack in response; if his target fails to overcome him on a normal resist roll, they find themselves unable to regain any Willpower lost to Wits Knacks for one full week, leaving them able to do little but brood on their stunning verbal defeat.

### LATERAL THINKING
Prerequisite: Meditative Focus

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this knack is so quick-witted and difficult to predict that those attempting to affect her mentally are at a serious disadvantage. She may add her Wits to any dice roll made to resist being affected by an outside power.

### LIGHTNING REFLEXES
Prerequisite: Talent Mirror

**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

While speed of the body never hurts when it comes to avoiding attacks, speed of the mind can be even more powerful for a Scion with this Knack. Whenever he chooses to spend the requisite cost, he heightens his reflexes and ability to recognize incoming attacks to truly divine levels; for the rest of the scene, his DV is calculated according to his Wits + Awareness instead of his Dexterity + Athletics.

### MASTER-AT-ARMS
Prerequisite: Ingenious Improviser

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

As deadly with a knitting needle as with a gun, the Scion with this Knack is never out of his depth when it comes to unexpected combat and unorthodox tools, able to turn anything to his advantage on the spur of the moment. Once per scene, he may roll his Wits instead of his Dexterity when attacking with an improvised weapon for the first time, bringing a refrigerator or truck tire to bear with devastating quickness.

### MEDITATIVE FOCUS
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is able to filter his surroundings with a great degree of accuracy, choosing which things to respond to and which can be safely ignored. He subtracts his Epic Wits from any penalty that would normally be imposed on him because of environmental distractions.

### MONKEY IN THE MIDDLE
Prerequisite: Evasive Action

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

A whirling dervish of unpredictable action, the Scion with this Knack is simply too fast and too crafty to be brought down by mere numbers alone. Whenever she would suffer the effects of a Coordinated Assault, or onslaught penalties her DV can never drop below her successes from Epic Wits (if her successes are higher than her normal DV, her normal DV applies).

### OPENING GAMBIT
Prerequisite: Rabbit Reflexes

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack can see violence about to erupt and head it off at the pass before anyone else has yet registered the impending conflict. By spending the requisite cost, he may forgo rolling to Join Battle and instead simply act before anyone else who did, allowing him to prevent an explosive situation from escalating or strike a first crippling blow against a hostile enemy. He must succeed on an opposed Wits + Awareness roll against any others attempting to use the same Knack in order to go first.

### OPENING SALVO
Prerequisite: Social Chameleon

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Politics

Quick-thinking as well as quick on her feet, the Scion with this Knack may wither those who annoy her with a well-placed phrase or insult. Once per day, she may level some form of insulting phrase or gesture at her target (it doesn’t have to be inspired, but she still has to make one) and attempt cut them to the quick, forcing them to roll Wits + Politics against her; if she succeeds, they lose half their total number of permanent Willpower (rounded down) from the mortifying slam to their ego, but if she loses will find herself subject to the same penalty, demoralized by her failure.

### PERFECT IMPOSTER
Prerequisite: Damage Control

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

No matter how alien a situation he might find himself in, the Scion with this Knack can always find a way to seamlessly blend in, picking up the customs and expectations of whatever culture he encounters with lightning speed. By spending the requisite cost, the Scion manages to garner the expectations and customs of a given culture from the words and actions of its members, and may behave as though totally versed in its customs from birth, avoiding the potential for embarrassing faux pas or violent misunderstandings as well as gaining insight into a new culture’s politics. Only those with more Epic Perception than he possesses Epic Wits notice that he is out of place.

### PSYCHIC PROFILER
Prerequisite: Social Chameleon

**Cost:** 1 Legend (if desired)

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Empathy

The Scion with this Knack makes instant and completely accurate snap judgments. With only a glance (assuming she can overcome her target’s automatic Manipulation + Empathy roll against her meddling), she can accurately assess any person’s age, addictions, compulsions they may be under, whether or not they have relationships of some kind with others nearby, whether or not they possess any divine heritage, Nature, Calling, highest Virtue, whether they are hiding any secrets, and whether or not they are currently playing a Fatebound role. All of this general information can be gleaned immediately simply by observing or conversing with her target for a number of minutes equal to ten minus her total number of Epic Wits dots; however, if the Scion wishes to learn more specific details on any of the above vague impressions, she must spend a point of Legend in order to do so.

### RABBIT REFLEXES
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Even when surprised, the Scion with this Knack has a decent chance of survival thanks to his ability to drop everything and haul ass away from a conflict. Whenever he is successfully ambushed or surprised, he may instantly attempt to flee the attack, running like a startled animal; his DV against that attack is doubled as his panicked reflexes take over. Once the initial shock has passed, he may turn around and return to the battle if he wishes.

### SCATHING RETORT
Prerequisite: Opening Salvo

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Politics

A witty insult can be a barb, but a snappy comeback from the Scion with this Knack can render even the most notorious of bards speechless. Whenever the Scion is insulted – either normally or via the Opening Salvo Knack – she may spend the requisite cost and snap back a rejoinder (it doesn’t have to be good, but she must still come up with one). When she does so, and her target fails to overcome her on an opposed Wits + Politics roll, the target of her wrath is instantly drained of Willpower equal to their normal Willpower maximum (if, however, her roll cannot overcome her target’s, the Scion finds herself unhappily experiencing the same consequences).

### SELFLESS SPEED
Prerequisite: Instant Assessment

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack turns his incredibly quick reaction time to the selfless aid of others, becoming a whirlwind of defensive action when those important to him are threatened. He may intentionally take a hit meant for another being every tick if he so chooses.

### SOCIAL CHAMELEON
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Politics

While the Scion with this Knack can’t really fake his way through everything he encounters, he can at least manage to do a good enough job to avoid notice if he puts some effort into it. As long as he makes a reasonable attempt (dressing the part, copying the lingo, etc.), he may blend in and go unnoticed in most social situations, just another face in the crowd. This Knack won’t save him from a really heinous misstep or prevent him from actively offending others; it just provides him with the ability to play along enough to avoid being instantly recognized as an outsider unless an onlooker overcomes his successes on a Perception + Politics roll.

### STUNT DRIVER
Prerequisite: Don’t Read the Manual

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Master of the jump and drift, brake and spin, the Scion with this Knack has a far greater chance than most to keep her toys in one piece. Whenever she is about to crash, collide with something, or be struck by outside forces while controlling a vehicle, she may pay the requisite cost to add her successes from Epic Wits to the vehicle’s soak, diving, driving or sailing so as to protect the most fragile parts of her ride. If, while thus augmented, the vehicle soaks all damage levied against it, passengers riding inside it (including the Scion herself) take no damage from the source she has defended against.

### TALENT MIRROR
Prerequisite: Jack of All Trades

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has elevated copycatting to an art form, rendering her able to perform feats she would never have been able to attempt on her own, provided she has seen someone else perform them first. By spending the requisite cost and attempting to copy another person’s movements exactly, she may duplicate any feat she has just seen someone else accomplish, borrowing the appropriate Attribute + Ability dice pool from that person and using it as if it were her own. She may also gain her target’s successes from Epic Attributes up to a maximum of her Epic Wits, and need not perform the exact same action as her target, merely one that utilizes the same dice pool. She must use the dice pool in the same scene that she saw her target do so, though she is not required to pay for this Knack until she does so. The Scion may only copy a number of dice pools in each scene equal to her total number of Epic Wits dots.

### UNCONQUERABLE CHALLENGE
Prerequisite: Selfless Speed

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Presence

Too quick to pin down but too taunting to be ignored, the Scion changes the flow of battle with this Knack faster than anyone else could even comprehend it. Whenever an opponent is about to strike another being or object, the Scion may spend the requisite cost to issue a challenge that cannot be ignored, whether it takes the form of a taunting jibe, a defiant scream or a noble demand to pick on someone your own size. When he does so and overcomes his foe’s resist roll, the attacker immediately redirects the attack to strike him instead; he cannot avoid being hit, but he retains his normal DV and may act as usual thereafter.
