### ARMOR CRUSHER
Prerequisite: Divine Rampage

**Cost:** 5 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has honed his instinct for destruction to a fine point, able to concentrate even on the moving armor of his foes in battle. For one scene, all physical attacks that utilize the Scion’s Strength to deal damage are armor-piercing; if his attack is already armor-piercing, it ignores armor completely. Any non-relic armor he strikes actually breaks; relic armor (and armor from other magical sources) remains intact but cannot prevent its wearer from suffering from the effects of this Knack.

### ATLAS SHRUG
Prerequisite: Uplifting Might

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Like the monolithic Titan for whom this Knack is named, its effects allow a Scion to lift unheard-of amounts of weight. For the duration of the scene in which she activates this Knack, she may lift up to five times the amount she would normally be able to, potentially making her able to hoist monsters, natural formations, and small buildings with aplomb. If she chooses to activate Uplifting Might first, this Knack’s effects take it into account.

### CRUSHING GRIP
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion’s natural strength is now so great that he no longer inflicts bashing damage while grappling, crushing opponents with lethal force. This Knack represents the Scion’s bodily strength, and as such is permanent; a Scion with this Knack who wishes to deal bashing damage must hold his strength back, taking the usual penalties associated with attacking with the flat of a blade.

### DISFIGURING ATTACK
Prerequisite: Divine Wrath

**Cost:** 5 Legend per attack

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has become an unstoppable force of violence; each attack she makes with this Knack inflicts aggravated damage and leaves a permanent, unsightly scar that can only be removed through use of the Regeneration Knack or the Human Clay Boon. The Scion may only deal such damage if she is attacking unarmed (though she may do so in either a brawl or a clinch), and must declare her intention and pay the requisite cost before rolling to attack an opponent.

### DIVINE BOUND
Prerequisite: Holy Bound

**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By channeling his prodigious strength into his legs, the Scion may jump one hundred times the distance he would normally be able to manage, making truly epic feats possible. When doing so, he moves at a speed of 100 yards every turn; if he wishes to jump less than his maximum distance, he must declare his intention to do so when activating this Knack, and may not change his mind in mid air. If he is damaged while jumping, however, he immediately begins to fall out of the air and must roll Dexterity + Athletics versus a difficulty of his Epic Strength successes in order to avoid injuring himself upon landing.

### DIVINE RAMPAGE
Prerequisite: Holy Rampage

**Cost:** 1 Legend per attack

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion is now a destructive force in her own right, able to destroy the most impervious of objects with a little determination. She may cut the soak of any inanimate object being held by someone in half for purposes of attempting to destroy it, or completely negate the soak of any unattended item.

### DIVINE WRATH
Prerequisite: Crushing Grip

**Cost:** 5 Legend per attack

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has strength far beyond the human body’s ability to withstand, and he is able to damage opponents as seriously as if they’d been struck with a weapon. He automatically deals lethal damage in any unarmed attack; a Scion with this Knack who wishes to do bashing damage must declare his intention and suffer the usual dice penalties of doing so. If he chooses to spend the Legend cost above, the Scion may deal aggravated damage while grappling, though he must declare his intention and pay the requisite cost before rolling to attack an opponent.

### EMPOWERED DEFLECTION
Prerequisite: Titanium Tools

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Normally, a Scion’s ability to parry is based upon the dexterousness of his defense as he dodges attacks, but a Scion with Empowered Deflection eschews such pussyfooting around and simply meets blows head-on, parrying them with a weapon or item. He may add his Legend rating and substitute his Strength for his Dexterity (without any successes from any Epic Attributes) when determining his Parry DV.

### FLICK
Prerequisite: One-Inch Punch

**Cost:** 3 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion’s strength is so great that it can physically affect the very air molecules around her. By making an unarmed attack gesture – a punch, a sweep, or even a simple flick of the fingers – she can focus her strength into the air around her and use it to strike an opponent from a distance. Due to the specialized nature of focusing her muscles so minutely, this Knack cannot be used for attacks involving weapons, and may never be used to inflict aggravated damage.

### FORCE WITH FINESSE
Prerequisite: Making It Look Easy

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

A master of balancing power and results, the Scion with this Boon can hit as hard as a train or as deftly as the fall of a snowflake. He does not have to announce that he is pulling his blow before attacking, and whenever he deals damage may choose to do any amount up to his roll instead of always dealing the full amount. He may only apply this to attacks that he makes physically, and may not do so when using firearms or magical effects.

### HANG ON
Prerequisite: Stalwart Cling

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Many weightlifters and bodybuilders can manage quick bursts of strength, but a Scion with this Knack goes much further, becoming able to sustain his prowess well beyond human norms. While performing any Feat of Strength that requires him to use a Strength Knack to succeed, he may spend the Legend cost to enhance his staying power, and may extend the effects of that Knack continuously for up to a number of days equal to his successes from Epic Strength. While he is dedicated to this specific feat, he ceases to require any food, water, sleep, or even air; however, if he ceases to perform it, this Knack’s effects immediately vanish.

### HOLY BOUND
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack combines strength and athletics to become a vaulter to put Olympian champions to shame. She may double the normal distance she is able to jump, and cover such distances with facile ease.

### HOLY RAMPAGE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Instead of attacking his fellow man, the Scion with this Knack specializes in property damage, able to break just about anything he comes across with a little concerted effort. He may halve the soak of any inanimate object he attempts to demolish, provided that no one is holding it at the time.

### HURL TO THE HORIZON
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Like the javelin-throwers of ancient Greece, the Scion with this Knack knows how to put her power behind an object to make it fly into the distance. She may double the normal distance she is able to hurl any object.

### HURL TO THE MOON
Prerequisite: Mighty Heave

**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The mighty throwing abilities of the Scion with this Knack are now so incredible that he freely ignores most rules of physics and aerodynamics. He may hurl any object that he is able to lift as far as he would normally be able to throw a tiny dart (this is in lieu of the bonus from Mighty Heave, not in addition to it); alternatively, if he is throwing a weapon, he may instead cause the attack to inflict aggravated damage upon his unfortunate target. He may only use one of these effects on any given attack.

### KNOCKBACK ATTACK
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By choosing to channel her attack into force instead of trauma, the Scion with this Knack may spend the cost to elect not to deal damage in an attack, instead hurling her opponent a number of yards away from her equal to her successes on her damage roll. She must declare her intention to do so and spend the requisite cost before rolling to attack.

### KNOCKBACK WAVE
Prerequisite: Knockback Attack

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Diffusing his great strength into the entire area around him rather than at a single target, the Scion with this Knack may now knock several opponents away from him, clearing a swath around his body. He may now use his Knockback Attack Knack against up to five people within his reach at once.

### LEGENDARY PARRY
Prerequisite: Empowered Deflection

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

No longer taking hits with only his mortal strength to back her up, the Scion with Legendary Parry may now, in addition to the effects of Empowered Deflection, also substitute her Epic Strength for her Epic Dexterity when determining her Parry DV.

### MAKING IT LOOK EASY
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack shows no visible effort when performing even the most strenuous of physical feats, shrugging off the inconvenience and incredible difficulty with ease. Onlookers are suitably impressed by his ability to do marvelous things without breaking a sweat, and he is able to divide his attention for conversation or other small actions, rather than being forced to focus solely on the task at hand. If he chooses to perform a feat of strength and an additional action, he does not suffer the usual -4 dice penalty for doing so; he may, however, perform two additional actions with a -4 penalty.

### MIGHTY HEAVE
Prerequisite: Hurl to the Horizon

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack now hurls objects with incredible force, outpacing the strongest of mortals with total ease. She may triple the normal distance she is able to throw any object (including the bonus she gains from Hurl to the Horizon); in addition, any weapon she hurls at a target that would normally inflict bashing damage inflicts lethal damage instead and becomes armor-piercing, and any normal-sized weapon thus thrown that would normally inflict lethal damage ignores armor entirely.

### ONE-INCH PUNCH
Prerequisite: Crushing Grip

**Cost:** 3 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

Even when restricted by confined space or prohibitive bonds, the Scion with this Knack is able to bring the full force of his lethal brawling abilities to bear. He may make any attack from a scant inch or two away with just as much force as if he’d had room to swing a haymaker, and takes no penalties to his damage rolls when attacking from restraints on any non-clinch brawl attack he makes. This Knack applies only to unarmed attacks and may not be combined with melee or throwing assaults.

### SHOCKWAVE
Prerequisite: Knockback Wave

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Strength + Brawl OR Strength + Melee

By striking the ground beneath her feet and spending the requisite cost, the Scion may cause a massive shockwave to ripple outward from her in a radius equal to her successes from Epic Strength in yards, knocking down and injuring any unfortunates standing within the affected area. All affected targets within the area must roll either Dexterity + Athletics or Stamina + Fortitude against the Scion’s successes as they try to avoid or withstand the shock; if they are unsuccessful, they immediately suffer an amount of armor-ignoring bashing damage equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, and must take a -4 penalty for the next turn as they recover their equilibrium. Objects that are not currently being worn or held also take this damage, which they may soak normally; no soak-reducing Knacks may be used on them with this attack.

### STALWART CLING
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per attack (if desired)

**Dice Pool:** None

The grip of a Scion with Stalwart Cling is literally almost unbreakable. By spending one Legend and bracing himself, the Scion with this Knack may not be thrown from a clinch by any opponent with equal or lesser Epic Strength, regardless of his attempts to press the issue. Due to the steely nature of his grip, any opponent that attempts to use the knack Escape Artist to wriggle out of his arms will suffer a reduction to their auto-successes from Dexterity equal to the Scion’s auto-successes from Strength.

### TITANIUM TOOLS
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The incredible strength of an augmented Scion is more than most objects can bear; weapons and even buildings crack and break at inconvenient times, and he may find himself without any suitable melee options. This Knack allows a Scion to lend some of his own hardiness to any object he uses as a weapon; it will not break, no matter how hard he strikes someone with it or how fragile it might normally be considered.

### UPLIFTING MIGHT
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

By planting her feet and concentrating, the Scion with this Knack may lift amounts far beyond her normal capacity (and, most likely, anyone else’s). She may double the amount of weight she is normally able to lift.

## DEXTERITY

### AND THE CROWD GOES WILD
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend (if desired) per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is an athlete par excellence, a cut above even the most well-trained of mortals. She may count her dots in Athletics as automatic successes instead of dice in any roll; if she wishes to pay a cost of one point of Legend, she may also count her dots in Arete: Athletics or any bonuses she might have to Athletics from Geasa.

### ANTI-GRAVITY CLIMBER
Prerequisite: Spider Climber

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is now truly outside the realm of normal locomotion, able to cross or climb any surface with mind-blowing ease. He may climb any surface, no matter how steep, and may do so as quickly as he would normally be able to dash; his gravity-defying powers are so great that he may even walk comfortably at any bizarre angle, or even totally upside down, as if he were merely strolling down the street. Climbing is not a separate action for him, as he can perform it as easily as moving on normal ground; if he is injured while climbing, however, he must gain as many successes as he took levels of damage on a Dexterity + Athletics roll in order to remain clinging to his perch.

### BLITZKRIEG
Prerequisite: Omnidexterity

**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per attack

**Dice Pool:** None

Where most Scions can only attack twice in one action, reflecting their human-level reflexes, a Scion with this Knack may attack three times, making himself a whirlwind of offensive action. Each attack must be made with a different weapon or appendage, requiring Scions to be fluid and creative; due to the Scion’s ability to sacrifice power and accuracy for speed, these attacks must be rolled at a -4 dice penalty and may not deal aggravated damage, but should they all be directed at the same opponent, that unlucky person will suffer a -3 to his DV from the overwhelming flurry.

### CAT’S GRACE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Graceful and surefooted on even the most unstable of terrains, the Scion with this Knack is almost impossible to knock off-balance; she always lands on her feet when thrown or falling, never suffers knockdown, and takes no penalties for unstable, rugged, or moving terrain as she finds her footing with supernatural ease.

### DIVINE BALANCE
Prerequisite: Cat’s Grace

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack puts the greatest kung fu masters to shame with his unassailable balance and control over his body. He may stand on or run across any surface, no matter how tiny or flimsy, even if it should not normally be able to hold his weight; his ability to redistribute his balance is so fine that he can dash across clotheslines or stand unmoving on the edge of a coin.

### ESCAPE ARTIST
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion may automatically escape from any bonds as long as she is not being actively watched at the time. If she is grappled, she may add her successes from Epic Dexterity as additional automatic successes in her attempt to wriggle free.

### FAST AS THOUGHT
Prerequisite: Lightning Sprinter

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

Breaking all natural laws for human speed, the Scion with this Knack may run at truly impressive velocities. She may double her normal movement and dash speeds (including the already doubled distance from the Lightning Sprinter Knack) and may even skip across the surface of liquids or ignore gravity for short bursts, provided that she does not slow down or stop moving. A Scion wishing to use Fast As Thought must first activate Lightning Sprinter, Lightning Flyer, or Lightning Swimmer, though both may be activated together as the same action if she so chooses.

### LIGHTNING FLYER
Prerequisite: Lightning Sprinter

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

Many Scions display superhuman speed on the ground, but a Scion with this Knack is equally speedy in the air. As in the Lightning Sprinter knack, a Scion with this power may double the amount of distance that she could normally fly in the same amount of time. Note that either of the advanced speed knacks (Fast as Thought or Peregrine Fleetness) will affect any of the three Lightning powers.

### LIGHTNING SPRINTER
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is one of the fastest around, able to cover great distances without effort. By spending the requisite cost, he may double the distance he could normally move or dash, and eliminate all penalties for marshy or wet terrain, as he is simply moving so quickly that he does not have time to get bogged down. Note that either of the advanced speed knacks (Fast as Thought or Peregrine Fleetness) will affect any of the three Lightning powers.

### LIGHTNING SWIMMER
Prerequisite: Lightning Sprinter

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The fastest Scion on land finds things to be a very different story when slowed down by the inescapable weight of water. As in the Lightning Sprinter knack, a Scion with this power may double the amount of distance that he could normally swim in the same amount of time. Note that either of the advanced speed knacks (Fast as Thought or Peregrine Fleetness) will affect any of the three Lightning powers.

### MICROSCOPIC PRECISION
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack needs no specialized tools when she wishes to perform delicate work; her control over even the most minute of her muscles is so great that she can complete any manipulation down to the nanometer, moving with incredible precision and exactness. While she has the manual dexterity to tinker with even the tiniest of microchips, it should be noted that if the Scion does not possess the appropriate amount of Epic Perception, she will still be unable to see what she is doing..

### MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD
Prerequisite: Photographic Penmanship

**Cost:** 3 Legend per attack

**Dice Pool:** None

A massive, overwhelming strike is fine in some situations, but some Scions prefer devastating, surgical precision. A Scion with this Knack knows exactly where to strike with the smallest and most unprepossessing of weapons, inflicting significant damage without necessarily possessing great strength. When wielding any small weapon (a scalpel, dagger, pen, pair of scissors, etc.), the Scion may pay the Legend cost to use her Dexterity when she rolls for damage, instead of her Strength. She must declare her intention to use this Knack and pay the requisite cost before rolling to attack.

### MONKEY CLIMBER
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack was born to climb, able to shimmy his way up normal surfaces without the aid of climbing equipment or ropes. He may climb as quickly as he could normally walk, and if necessary take other actions while climbing without fear of falling to his death (though he is still subject to a -4 dice penalty for doing so).

### OMNIDEXTERITY
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The ambidextrous of the world are often envied for the greater freedom they have when it comes to movement and manipulation, but the Scion with this Knack takes that freedom to its extreme, so flexible and in control of her movements that she is literally universally dexterous. She may use any movable part of her body as well as if it were her dominant hand, making it child’s play to sew with her feet or shoot a gun with her tongue. This also allows the scion to make 2 attacks in one turn at a -4 dice penalty for each attack. The Scion must be using two different weapons to make this attack. 

### PEREGRINE FLEETNESS
Prerequisite: Fast as Thought

**Cost:** 5 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion’s speed is now not only superhuman but far above the level that most animals or even gods can aspire to. This knack triples the speed granted by its prerequisite, Fast as Thought, making the Scion literally so fast that he is almost impossible to see or affect as long as he does not slow down or stop moving. There are dangers associated with moving at such a heightened velocity, however; a Scion with less Epic Perception than he has Epic Dexterity must make a Wits + Awareness roll to avoid running into an obstacle that he approaches too quickly to properly avoid. A Scion wishing to use Peregrine Fleetness must first activate Fast As Thought and either Lightning Sprinter, Lightning Flyer, or Lightning Swimmer, though all three may be activated together as the same action if he so chooses.

### PERFECT PARTNER
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has become so permanently attuned to the movements of others that she may match or mirror them perfectly and unconsciously, as if she had foreknowledge of their actions; she is a cooperative laborer without peer, a comrade-in-arms without measure, and a lover defying description. She may always join any coordinated assault, even if there were not enough successes rolled to include her, and may automatically create a miniature coordinated assault with one other person by attacking in concert with them.

### PHOTOGRAPHIC PENMANSHIP
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Some Scions are so in tune with their body’s movements that they can mentally map out the exact motions required to create something they have only seen. The Scion with this Knack may write or draw any text, image, or symbols that he has previously seen, creating exact copies of anything that he has visually experienced. He may draw or write up to one square yard of imagery for every point of Legend he wishes to spend.

### RICOCHET SYMPHONY
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Able to accommodate the tiny shifts in the air around her and eyeball the angles of any area instantly, the Scion with this Knack may throw objects in impossible curves, negating the effects of obstacles in her way. She may throw any item around an object or even around a ninety-degree corner, enabling her to toss a weapon to a surrounded ally or even strike an enemy behind a barricade with a perfectly thrown spear. She may apply the same principles to firearms and ranged weapons as well, allowing her to shoot around corners with uncanny accuracy.

### ROLL WITH IT
Prerequisite: And the Crowd Goes Wild

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is a master of rolling with the punches, knowing just where to let himself go boneless and just how to move to diffuse the shock of a blow. Any time he is struck and dealt damage, he may spend the Legend cost to add his dots in Epic Dexterity to any of his soaks as he allows the blow to move him rather than remaining in staunch resistance to it.

### SHOT TO THE HEART
Prerequisite: Trick Shooter

**Cost:** 2 Legend per attack

**Dice Pool:** None

A gunman without peer, the Scion with this Knack knows exactly where to aim to deal the most devastating damage, circumventing the attempts of opponents to avoid her. If she chooses a specific body part on an opponent and takes an aiming action before shooting with a non-thrown weapon, she may completely ignore armor when causing damage, though she must declare her intention to do so and spend the requisite cost before rolling to attack.

### SPIDER CLIMBER
Prerequisite: Monkey Climber

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

No longer constrained by mere mortal standards of climbability, the Scion with this Knack may now scale any surface that could be climbed by a spider, enabling her to zoom up sheer walls or navigate quickly between vines and strands. She may climb as quickly as she could normally dash if there are suitable hand- or footholds where she is climbing and take other actions without penalty; if she chooses to scale a totally smooth surface, she may do so at the same speed she could normally walk and must still suffer a -4 dice penalty when performing other actions at the same time.

### TRICK SHOOTER
Prerequisite: Ricochet Symphony

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is not just a gunman but a showman as well, able to pull off the most impressive feats of marksmanship with flair. When using a ranged or thrown weapon, he may double the dice he receives from aiming as he finds the exact points of weakness in a target, and suffers no penalties when attempting to disarm an opponent at range. If he is using a firearm, he may choose to pull his blow without announcing it first, and may choose to inflict any amount of damage up to the maximum from his roll.

### UNTOUCHABLE OPPONENT
Prerequisite: Divine Balance

**Cost:** 3 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

As active and quick as a mirage, the Scion with this Knack is extraordinarily difficult to hit, being too limber and well-practiced in dodging to strike without a great deal of effort; even those who do manage to strike her seldom do more than wing her as they go by. Whenever the Scion goes forth into battle, she may add her dots in Epic Dexterity to her DV, turning powerful cleaves and swings into mere nicks and glancing blows.

### WHIRLWIND SHIELD
Prerequisite: Microscopic Precision

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

No stranger to being the target of unfriendly attention, the Scion with this Knack has reflexes so finely honed that he may block even the fastest of ranged missiles directed at him. As long as he describes a satisfactory stunt to the Storyteller and pays the requisite cost when he is attacked at range, he may substitute his Parry DV for his Dodge DV, deflecting bullets and knocking arrows out of the air.

## STAMINA

### BEZOAR
Prerequisite: Devourer

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

So ironclad is the Scion’s control over her own body that she may halt its processes in order to server her, using it as a hiding place or storage container whenever she sees the need. She may at any point swallow any object or substance she could conceivably fit into her stomach; once she has done so, she may keep it there indefinitely without digesting it, carrying it around until she decides she needs it back, when she may regurgitate it unharmed. She may only carry as many objects as can fit in her stomach, but while they are there, mundane attempts to detect them fail automatically without the aid of x-rays; only those with Epic Perception have a chance to realize that she carries a secret cache.

### BODY ARMOR
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has learned to harness the toughness inherent in his divine ichor, hardening his skin so thoroughly that he may parry any attack with his body instead of requiring a weapon or shield to do so. If he chooses to spend the Legend cost, he may cause his ichor to flow over his body from within, creating a flexible second skin of armor in order to protect himself. This armor adds the Scion’s dots of Epic Stamina to his bashing and lethal soaks; as the armor is a manifestation of the Scion’s divine heritage, it is typically different in appearance for each Scion.

### BRICK WALL
Prerequisite: Invulnerable Nail

**Cost:** 1 or 3 Legend per attack

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Fortitude

The Scion with this knack has surpassed normal levels of resilience and is literally so tough that an opponent may find themselves hurt more by an attack than their intended victim. Whenever the Scion is struck by a physical, non-ranged attack and pays the Legend cost (1 for bashing or 3 for lethal), he may apply his successes as damage against his attacker. While this knack affects all bashing and lethal attacks, it cannot be used against attacks that deal aggravated damage.

### DAMAGE CONVERSION
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Endurance lies not only in being able to take a hit but in being able to shake it off afterward, and the Scion with this Knack is a master of the latter. Whenever she is dealt lethal damage, she may spend the requisite Legend cost to convert it to bashing, reducing the heinous open wounds of blades and teeth to nothing more than heavy bruising. This Knack may only be used reflexively when the Scion takes damage.

### DEVOURER
Prerequisite: Inner Furnace

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Unbound by the restrictions of a normal digestive system, the Scion with this Knack is so bent on survival that he can convert any solid compound into a source of nourishment. Plastic, metal, and rock serve as legitimate edible substances for him, and he may consume them in lieu of food if he so desires (or finds that he has no other choices at the moment).

### DIVINE DAMAGE CONVERSION
Prerequisite: Damage Conversion

**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Even the most soul-rending of wounds can be defeated by a Scion’s determined endurance, allowing anyone who possesses this Knack to avoid the devastating effects of supernatural damage. A Scion with this Knack may spend the requisite cost when she is dealt aggravated damage in order to convert that damage to lethal, turning a life-ending attack into a painful and inconvenient but nevertheless survivable affair. She may only use this Knack reflexively when she takes damage, and she may not use it at the same time that she uses the Damage Conversion Knack (she must choose one or the other).

### DIVINE FORTITUDE
Prerequisite: Holy Fortitude

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is an unstoppable force when he chooses to be, ignoring the paltry needs for rest and nourishment that plague most of his fellow men. He may work ceaselessly at any strenuous activity for twice the amount of time he might normally (this includes the bonus from the Holy Fortitude Knack), and no longer requires either water, food or sleep to sustain him (he must choose one of the three to ignore, not all of them).

### EXTENDED YOUTH
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

For the Scion with this Knack, age, the great equalizer, no longer applies. She ceases to grow older entirely, remaining eternally at her current age.

### HOLY FORTITUDE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The conditions of fatigue and hunger seldom apply to the Scion with this Knack; he is able to soldier on without apparent hardship long past the point that many others would have given up. He may double the amount of time he can work continuously at any strenuous activity, and may go for twice as long without sleep, food and water as he would normally be able to.

### IMPENETRABLE
Prerequisite: Body Armor

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has developed even beyond the toughness of most of her peers, now able to shrug off truly grievous damage with a thought. When she has the Body Armor knack activated, the Scion also gains an amount of additional aggravated soak equal to half her dots of Epic Stamina. The armor’s protection extends to her clothes, preserving them against most calamities, and she may spend an additional point of Legend to render a piercing attack non-piercing.

### INNER FURNACE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has a cast-iron stomach, able to glean sustenance where he should not and to ignore the effects of poisons and toxins in his food. He may eat and derive nourishment from any organic compound, no matter how rancid or normally inedible it might be, and the efficiency of his digestive system renders him completely immune to any ingested poisons or drugs, including alcohol (though he may still be affected by airborne poisons or drugs or those injected directly into his bloodstream).

### INTERNAL REFINERY
Prerequisite: Devourer

**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Beyond even the amazing digestive benefits she derives from the Inner Furnace and Devourer Knacks, the Scion may now use her own body as a refinery, purifying and rendering the elements that she puts into it at will. In addition to being immune to all poisons, toxins, and drugs, she may also spend the Legend cost to ingest a harmful substance and then secrete an antidote for it, which she may eject in any way she chooses (spitting, etc.) to use to aid someone less hardy.

### INVULNERABLE NAIL
Prerequisite: Impenetrable

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By concentrating her divine fortitude into a specific point, the Scion with this Knack may temporarily channel his defense into a tiny portion of his body, rendering it almost completely unassailable. When the Scion is attacked and has the opportunity to see the incoming blow, he may spend the requisite Legend cost to add his successes from Epic Stamina to all soaks for a specific, small point on his body. This power may only be used outside of combat, and cannot be used on surprise attacks or any attacks that the Scion could not reasonably be said to have seen coming; it can only apply to a tiny area (one square inch or smaller) at a time.

### LAST ACT
Prerequisite: Tireless Worker

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

So great is the Scion’s stamina when he has this Knack that he can keep moving long after others would fall, even once he is mortally and finally wounded. Whenever he takes damage that would incapacitate him, the Scion may spend this Knack’s cost to stay upright through sheer determination, remaining active for a number of additional actions equal to the Legend spent (1 if he has 1-4 dots of Epic Stamina, 2 if he has 5-8 and 3 if he has 9 or more). During this time, the Scion may be healed and prevented from lapsing into unconsciousness. If he takes damage that would kill him, this Knack has no cost; if he simply remains active for a number of hours equal to his Epic Stamina dots as his body refuses to give up until the very end, giving him time to call out his last words, destroy his enemies in a final blow, or make a last grand gesture before collapsing; he cannot be healed during this time, however, as he is beyond saving.

### NATURAL JUGGERNAUT
Prerequisite: Holy Fortitude

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Whether it be amazing genetics or an innate ability to understand his own body, there is no physical trial that the Scion with this knack cannot learn to master, and no discipline that he shies away from. The experience cost for him to learn the Empathy, Fortitude, Integrity, and Survival abilities is halved.

### RAGING BULL
Prerequisite: Natural Juggernaut

**Cost:** 3 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack not only refuses to be cowed by physical hardship, but actually becomes stronger for it. Instead of taking dice penalties when she is injured, the Scion actually gains a number of dice equivalent to the penalty she would have based on her injuries (this is applied even if she has so much Epic Stamina that she no longer takes wound penalties). In addition, she may reflexively spend a point of Legend any time she is injured in order to regain a point of Willpower in defiance of the opposition arrayed against her.

### RAISE YOUR GLASS
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

At any time the opportunity presents itself, the Scion with this Knack may astound others with his drinking prowess, gaining back a point of Legend for the feat. He must do this in an awe-inspiring manner (whether an expansive toast, a feat of endurance, or a grand gesture), and he must be seen by at least one person who has not previously seen him use this Knack; in addition, the use of this Knack renders him unable to use his Epic Stamina or the Inner Furnace Knack to avoid feeling the effects of the alcohol, making him fully capable of getting very drunk. This Knack may be used only once per day.

### REGENERATION
Prerequisite: Self-Healing

**Cost:** Varies

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has such control over her body that she can even convince it to remember its undamaged state and change accordingly. By spending the requisite amount of Legend, once per day she may use her ichor to regenerate her own limbs and organs. The Legend cost varied based on the severity of the damage and complexity of the organ.

### SELF-HEALING
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 2 Legend per health level

**Dice Pool:** None

When even the most rigid of defensive tactics fail, the Scion with this Knack can bounce back as if nothing happened, wounds vanishing as if they had never been. Once per day, by concentrating for five seconds and allowing his body to re-knit itself, he may heal as many levels of damage as he wishes to spend the Legend for, up to a maximum equal to his dots in Epic Stamina.

### SKIN-SHEDDING
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack has no issue with shedding a part in order to preserve the greater whole. When struck by an attack that would have knocked her back, she may spend a point of Legend to let the blow literally knock her out of her skin, which remains behind to absorb all the damage. While she takes absolutely no damage when she does this, she is able to do so only once per scene.

### SOLIPSISTIC WELL-BEING
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Ignorance is bliss, especially in the case of a Scion with this Knack. If at any point he is the victim of a surprise attack, he may simply ignore it as if it never happened, taking no damage as long as he was unaware that he was about to be struck; his self-assurance is so strong that it causes his body to literally conform to his vision of reality, refusing to be damaged when he believes it to be whole. While the attack will do no damage, it will typically alert the Scion to his attacker’s presence and he will realize that an attempt has been made on his life, which renders this Knack unusable for future attacks from the same source.

### TIRELESS WORKER
Prerequisite: Divine Fortitude

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion is able to work unceasingly for any length of time without requiring rest or sustenance of any kind.

### UNBREAKABLE
Prerequisite: Divine Damage Conversion

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per attack

**Dice Pool:** None

Many Scions have picked up the ability to lessen their injuries to keep them active longer, but the Scion with this knack refuses point-blank to take any injuries at all. Every time damage would be dealt to the Scion after she has already lessened an attack’s effects with Damage Conversion or Divine Damage Conversion, she may spend one Legend per additional point of damage she wishes to soak, up to a maximum amount of Legend equal to her Epic Stamina successes.

### UNDER PRESSURE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack knows how to maintain his body’s equilibrium, no matter what outside forces might be trying to do to it. He is unaffected by atmospheric pressure (whether from being high above the mountains, deep beneath the sea, or even in space) and suffers no difficulties from intense pressure or depressurization.

### WHALE’S BREATH
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

With lungs of steel, the Scion with this Knack seldom lacks for air, having the stamina to hold onto her own reserves for impressive amounts of time. She may hold her breath for triple the normal amount of time she would be able to, and even speak intelligibly underwater as she can focus her airstream perfectly to do so.
