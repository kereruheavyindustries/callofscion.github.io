### ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon can link herself to the ground beneath her, borrowing its immovability for a short period of time. By standing on bare earth, stone or some other earthen substance and paying the requisite cost, the Scion becomes almost impossible to move; she becomes immune to knockback and knockdown and may only be lifted by an assailant with more dots of Epic Strength than she has Earth Boons. The Scion remains unshakable for the rest of the scene; she may move herself, but doing so breaks her connection to the earth and she must renew it if she wishes to become immovable again.

### SAFELY INTERRED ●
**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon is attuned to the earth, which shifts itself to accommodate him when possible; he is never harmed by falling rubble, and even if buried beneath the earth itself takes no crushing penalties (though air may still be an issue). He takes no damage from earth-based trauma, including uses of other Earth purviews, and no longer suffers any penalty for unstable footing as long as he stands on earth of some kind.

### ECHO SOUNDING ●●
**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Awareness

By tapping, stomping or knocking on the ground, the Scion with this Boon may judge its depth and hardness, whether there are any buried items or holes beneath it, and how far away such items might be. She may successfully sound an amount of earth equal to her successes in miles, spread as she chooses between depth and radius. The Scion may only use this Boon on the earth itself or on the ground floor of a building with no air space between it and the ground.

### TECTONIC STRENGTH ●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By touching the earth to which she is attuned, the Scion with this Boon may draw strength from it to augment her own abilities. She may touch the earth at any time to commune with it (2 turn action); once she has done so and paid the requisite cost, she may add twice her total number of Earth Boons to her Strength rating for the next feat of strength she attempts. This Boon does not stack with itself; it can be used to augment a specific feat only once.

### SHAPING ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** Dexterity + Art (related)

The Scion with this Boon may shape any dirt, metal, glass, or other earth-based substance as though it were malleable clay, creating objects, artwork or even merely escape routes with ease. The Scion may only shape up to one cubic yard of earth per success on his activation roll.

### SUMMON GOBLINS ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

By calling forth in a commanding manner, the Scion may summon goblins to do her bidding. Upon being summoned, the goblins must be paid with their preferred price, a meat pie (alternatively, they will accept a magical item – a trinket, relic, or trophy – or a lump-sum payment of 3 Legend per goblin; however, these alternatives become very expensive very quickly); if they are not paid, they will refuse to obey the Scion’s commands and may even intentionally cause mischief for her before vanishing again. The summoned goblins possess the Safely Interred and Echo Sounding Boons, and can work tirelessly at simple tasks (digging, cleaning, farming, etc.), though more complicated orders may pose difficulties. For every three successes she garners on her activation roll, the Scion may choose to either summon an additional goblin or to add one day to the time that they will remain to serve her. If no extra days are purchased with successes, the goblins depart at sunset.

### EARTH ARMOR ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

By stomping on some naked earthen ground or surface, a Scion with this Boon can cause a cloud of that earth to fly up around him, creating armor of hardened earth around his body, granting him an additional bashing and lethal soak equal to his total number of Earth Boons as well as making him immune to piercing on weapons and weighing him down with a -2 mobility penalty to movements. This Boon requires that some earthen substance be available nearby, but it may be used in conjunction with other armoring powers. The armor remains for a scene, after which it turns back into its constituent earth.

### RUST/SHINE ●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this boon has mastered the rot and reformation of metal; she may restore any rusted item to its unmarred, brilliant original state, or alternatively cause a metal object (even one normally impervious to oxidization) to instantly and spontaneously rust, cutting its soak in half. If the Scion chooses to use this power on a weapon, she may give it a +4 bonus to its accuracy for the remainder of the day as she removes the tiny inconsistencies and imperfections that might cause it to waver, or a -4 negative as she causes it to become pitted and unwieldy; if she chooses to spend a permanent point of Willpower, she may make this bonus or penalty permanent.

### EARTH TRAVEL ●●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Like a fish, the Scion with this power may swim through earth and rock itself as easily as if it were water for the rest of the scene, leaving no trail behind him. He may not pass through manmade alloys, and while he always instinctively knows in which direction the surface lies, he has no extra innate knowledge of his location or what might be above him.

### QUICKSAND ●●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Survival

The Scion with this Boon may create a vast quagmire of sucking quicksand with a thought, covering an area of up to three square yards for every success she gains on her activation roll (this requires that she have existing earth or stone to work with, but any kind will do). Anyone caught within the quicksand’s radius becomes unable to take Dash actions and incurs a mobility penalty equal to the Scion’s total number of Earth Boons; on their action, they must receive at least five successes on a Strength + Athletics roll to avoid being sucked further into the bog, and each consecutive roll adds one to the difficulty. Any unfortunate target that fails three such rolls is sucked completely under, there to suffocate to death unless rescued. Beings with the Divine Balance knack are immune to these effects. The Scion herself may spend one additional point of Legend to swim within the affected area as if she had the Lightning Swimmer knack, affording her the opportunity for quick travel or getaways.

### EARTH BODY ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend, or 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

By calling out the name of the substance he wishes to turn into and converting his body to pure earth or stone, the Scion with this Boon becomes immobile, able to hear and see around him while disguised as an innocuous statue. If he chooses to pay the greater cost, he may also have the ability to move while thus transformed (he may, if he chooses to pay the lower cost, pay the difference at any time to begin moving). The Scion may use the Shaping Boon, if he possesses it, to change his own appearance however he sees fit, though any changes will vanish when he reverts to his usual form; others may not use the Shaping Boon on him, as he is only temporarily made of stone. The Scion’s soaks increase by half his total number of Earth Boons, and he is unaffected by armor-piercing or –ignoring effects; however, he also gains a mobility penalty of -4 and becomes 100 pounds heavier for every Earth Boon he possesses, making him difficult to move and potentially hazardous on any but the most sturdy of floors.

### EARTHBORN SPIRIT ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

When a Scion possesses this boon, her control over the earth is so great that she may summon up its very spirit to act on her behalf. Upon paying the requisite cost, the Scion summons a ten-foot-tall earth elemental of enormous strength and endurance which obeys her commands to the best of its ability. For every five successes past the first on her activation roll, the Scion may summon an additional elemental; alternatively, she may add 3 to her already-summoned elementals’ health and soaks, 2 to their damage, and 1 to their accuracy, speed, and DV. The elemental receives ten automatic successes to all physical feats or attacks and has the following abilities if unaugmented:

| Accuracy: 5 | Damage: 10 | Soaks: 25  |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Health: 25 | Speed: 15 | DV: 13 |

The elementals possess the same level 5 Earth Boon(s) as the Scion and need never pay for them, though they may only use them once per scene. In addition, the elementals may at any time reform in front of another person or object at the Scion’s discretion and absorb an attack directed at it, provided that they are holding action or Guarding at the time (this is a 2 turn). Targets who are also skilled in the Earth purview have an additional soak versus the elemental’s attacks equal to the number of Earth Boons they possess, and may add the same amount to all damage when attacking the creature. At the end of the scene, the elemental returns to the earth whence it came.

### IMPRISONING CRYSTAL ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 2 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Survival

The Scion with this Boon may imprison a target in a gigantic clear crystal, completely immobilizing them and preventing any damage from being done to them while they are so captured. The Scion must overcome her target’s Strength + Fortitude roll in order to trap them, and any threshold successes are applied to the crystal’s soak and health levels (which begin at a base equal to the Scion’s total number of Earth Boons, multiplied by two). A trapped creature is effectively in stasis, unable to move, speak, or interact with others, but also immune to the effects of aging, disease, wounds, etc. The crystal lasts for a number of days equal to the Scion’s total number of Earth Boons unless she chooses to expend an additional two points of Willpower, in which case it remains for a number of additional days equal to her threshold successes.

### LANDSLIDE ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** Strength + Survival

No longer confined to small samples of earth, the Scion may now shape massive quantities of raw materials with a thought. Upon activating this Boon, the Scion becomes able to mentally control and change a quantity of earth and stone equal to five times his successes in cubic yards; he may cause mountains and walls to thrust up from the ground, open yawning sinkholes, or attempt to crush his enemies with an onslaught of earth. Targets of the Scion’s wrath (or anyone within the affected area) may attempt to keep their footing and avoid being injured with a successful Dexterity + Athletics roll; if they overcome his successes on the activation roll, they are able to keep up with the quickly shifting landscape and take no damage or movement penalties. If they fail, the Scion controlling the earth may inflict a -4 penalty to all rolls on them at any time he chooses during the scene (unless they possess the Divine Balance knack, in which case they are immune). As a 1 turn action, the Scion may use the earth he controls to make a precision strike against up to four targets by rolling against their DV; if he strikes, he does an amount of damage equal to his threshold plus five times his total number of Earth Boons to the unfortunate victims. Targets who are also skilled in the Earth purview have an additional soak versus the Scion’s attacks equal to the number of Earth Boons they possess. The Scion may also sculpt and shape the earth under his command as he chooses; if he wishes, he may use this Boon to make one dramatic permanent alteration to the landscape, such as creating an island or mountain or burying an entire village. If two Scions attempt to use this Boon on the same land at the same time, the one with the higher roll takes control for the next 2 turns, at which point the other may initiate another roll to contest it.

### EARTH CREATION ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per 2 cubic yards

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion may create a sphere of any earthen substance (dirt, untainted metal, glass, etc.) out of thin air. The Scion may create as much earth as he wishes to pay for.

### PROPERTY INFUSION ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Art (appropriate)

The Scion with this Boon bends the rules of the natural world to her whim, playing with the very elemental building blocks that make up its foundations. By paying the requisite amount, the Scion may permanently alter any one earthen substance that he is touching so that it possesses a specific quality of another, giving glass walls the resilience of iron, common dirt the brilliance of gold, or formerly trusty weapons the room-temperature melt of mercury. If the Scion wishes to attempt to affect a Relic, he must overcome five times the Relic’s rating on his activation roll in order to do so. These changes are permanent and may not stack (that is, this Boon may not be used to enhance a given item more than once), though a Scion may attempt to remove modifications to an item with the use of this Boon.

### EARTH BEAST ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend and 2 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

The Scion with this power may command the most awesome of the earth’s creatures, a being of stone, mud or immovable dirt. A massive creature (each Scion should chose a unique creature to represent him upon purchasing this Boon, appropriate to his character and culture of origin) created from the bones of the earth itself, the beast will fulfill the Scion’s commands to the best of its abilities, giving him a gigantic war machine poised at his command. The beast receives 20 automatic successes to all physical feats or attacks and has the following abilities:

| Accuracy: 10 | Damage: 20 | Soaks: 50  |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Health: 200 | Speed: 15 | DV: 10 |

The beast naturally possesses the Earth Travel Boon and need never pay for it; it also possesses whichever level 7 Earth Boon the Scion does, and may use it for free as a 10-tick action. In addition, the creature may use the following special powers:

Intercept – the beast may at any time place itself in front of another person or object at the Scion’s discretion and absorb an attack directed at it, provided that it is holding action or Guarding at the time (this is a 5-tick action).

Rupture – the beast may take a 10-tick action, during which time it is Inactive; at the end of that time, it may burst out of the earth and attack its target with the element of surprise, rendering their DV down to 0 (this element of surprise may be circumvented by anyone with the Echo Sounding boon active, as he or she will hear the creature’s approach). Targets who are also skilled in the Earth purview have an additional soak versus the beast’s attacks equal to the number of Earth Boons they possess, and may add the same amount to all damage when attacking the creature. At the end of the scene, the dragon returns from whence it came, leaving the Scion on his own once again.

### MAGMA CONTROL ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Survival

The destructive blood of the earth, pure molten magma and lava, are now under the Scion’s direct control. He is immune to damage or burning from any form of molten rock, and may direct the flow of up to ten times his total number of Earth Boons in cubic yards of it, creating barriers or even attacking hapless enemies with its devastating power (a Scion with the Echo Sounding Boon active may even control magma beneath the earth that he cannot see). Attacks made with magma or lava use Strength + Survival to hit, and inflict dice of aggravated damage equal to 10 plus the Scion’s successes (in addition, the lava may damage Relics); the target continues to lose one health level every five ticks thereafter as the lava slowly burns through him for a further number of ticks equal to half the Scion’s total number of Earth Boons.

### SEISMIC DISRUPTION ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend and 2 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Strength + Survival

The Scion with this Boon may shift and shake the very tectonic plates of the earth itself, causing massive quakes and tremors to devastate the countryside wherever she chooses. By spending the requisite cost and striking the ground or screaming her command to the earth, the Scion may cause it to shudder and buck, inciting a full earthquake with Richter Scale severity equal to one tenth of her successes to strike in her immediate area, regardless of whether or not the tectonic plates beneath her are inclined toward violence. The quake’s effects may only be avoided on a person-by-person basis by a successful roll of either Dexterity + Athletics or Stamina + Fortitude; if any person does not succeed in this roll, they immediately suffer from knockdown and take bashing damage equal to the Scion’s threshold successes. The earthquake’s full effects are as follows:

| Richter Scale Rating | Difficulty to Avoid Damage | Mortal Population Killed | Earthquake’s Effects | After-Effects  |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 – 3 | — | — | Minor tremors, consternation | — |
| 4 | 5 | 5% | Only those at the epicenter roll (those with Cat’s Grace are immune) | — |
| 5 | 8 | 5% | Range of 10 miles (those with Divine Balance are immune) | — |
| 6 | 11 | 5% | Severe damage to small buildings and bridges, range of 100 miles | — |
| 7 | 15 (within 100 miles) or 11 (within 500 miles) | 10% | Severe damage to large buildings, range of 1,000 miles | A few local Richter 5 aftershocks |
| 8 | 20 (within 100 miles) or 15 (within 500 miles) or 10 (within 1000 miles) | 10% | Total destruction of all buildings, severe damage for 500 miles, full range of 2,000 miles | A few Richter 6 aftershocks on the same continent; a few tsunamis |
| 9 | 30 (within 1000 miles) or 20 (within 2000 miles) ot 10 (within 3000 miles) | 10% | Total destruction of all landscape and creations within 100 miles, full range of 5,000 miles | Worldwide tsunamis and aftershocks of varying severity |
| 10 | 40 (within 2000 miles) or 20 (within 3000 miles) or 10 (within 5000 miles) | 20% | Total destruction of all landscape and creations within 500 miles, severe damage to major buildings with 1,000 miles, damage to small buildings within 3,000 miles, heavy tremors within 5,000 miles, full range of 10,000 miles | Islands sink, volcanoes erupt, tsunamis and aftershocks of intense severity worldwide |

### THE SHAPER
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion becomes the avatar of the earth itself, able to cause immobile masses to move, destroy buildings, or raise the ground up with him.
