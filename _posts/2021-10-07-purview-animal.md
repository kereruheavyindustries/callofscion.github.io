Upon purchasing their first Boon in the Animal purview, Scions must choose a specific animal as their favored one for purposes of the purview. All powers refer to and affect only that animal unless otherwise specified, though the Scion may buy the same Boon more than once in order to use it on more than one kind of creature. Scions can have 1 animal, Demigods can have 2, Gods can have 3.

### ANIMAL COMMUNICATION ●
**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Upon purchasing this Boon, the Scion becomes able to communicate effortlessly with specimens of his chosen animal through their native speech (by chirping, growling, bubbling, etc).

### ANIMAL OBEDIENCE ●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Animal Ken

Difficulty: Animal’s Intelligence X Animal’s (Legend – 1)

The Scion with this Boon may force a specimen of his chosen animal to do his bidding, whether it wants to or not. He may not force the animal to act in what it would consider an actively suicidal manner, and animals frequently do not understand complex, multi-part instructions, but he may instruct it to do anything within these limits. If the Scion does not have Animal Communication, he must be able to communicate his order nonverbally. If the Scion attempts to command a Legendary beast, the difficulty of the roll is multiplied by the creature’s Legend – 1.

### ANIMAL ADAPTATION ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Once per story arc, the Scion may choose to change his chosen animal. This will last for the remainder of the story arc, or until the scion wishes for it to be changed back.

### ANIMAL ASPECT ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per action

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken

Upon purchasing this Boon, the Scion’s player must choose (with GM approval) two attributes (with a maximum of one physical) that he believes are the most favored by his chosen animal (for example, an owl might use Perception and Intelligence, or an armadillo Stamina and Wits). When activating this Boon, the Scion may add his successes as temporary dots of one of those two attributes. If he wishes the bonus to persist past the first action that he takes, he may pay additional Legend, but he must do so when he first activates the power and cannot do so reflexively later; the Boon’s effects last for a number of turns equal to the number of Legend points he chooses to spend (and he must spend a minimum of three). A Scion may never call upon the aspects of two different animals at once; only one use of this Boon may be active at one time.

### CALL OF THE WILD ●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Animal Ken

The Scion with this Boon is able to attune herself to her chosen creatures so perfectly that they are drawn to her as if summoned. By calling them in some appropriate manner (howling, buzzing, or calling out in their language), the Scion may put out a call to all specimens of her chosen animal within a radius equal to her successes in miles, exhorting them to find her. Affected animals immediately begin traveling toward her, though depending on their natural speed they may take some time to reach her. If at any point the Scion deems she has made contact with enough animals, she may call out to inform nearby animals that she no longer requires their presence; all those still journeying toward her are free to return to whatever they were doing (though some may still arrive, lost or curious). Once they have arrived, most animals will be inclined to remain with the Scion for at least a little while, though nothing forces them to do so if they circumstances are uncomfortable or threatening.

### RIDE ANIMAL ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Animal Ken

Difficulty: Animal’s Intelligence X Animal’s (Legend – 1)

The Scion with this Boon may possess and control the body of any specimen of her chosen animal, directing it at will as if it were her own. While doing so, her own body remains in a trance and is both unable to perceive its surroundings and unable to take actions; if at any time her body takes damage while she is riding a beast, she may spend a point of Willpower to briefly peer back through her own perceptions to see what caused this distraction. The Scion may return to her body whenever she wishes, though doing so breaks her link with her chosen creature.

### ANIMAL FEATURE ●●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use, and 1 Legend per feature

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken

The Scion with this Boon may physically alter a feature of his body into one possessed by his chosen animal; he might grow wings or a beak, claws, a tail, or any other feature that he deems useful. Doing so allows him to add his total number of Animal Boons as dice to an ability associated with that feature (as in Animal Aspect, the player must decide what ability each feature grants when this Boon is purchased, and may not change this choice later). Features with an auxiliary use (i.e., wings that allow flight, gills that allow water breathing, etc.) do not provide an additional dice bonus. Every five successes on his activation roll allow him to activate another feature, to a maximum of half the number of Boons he has in the Animal purview, rounded down. The feature remains for the rest of the scene, or until the Scion voluntarily chooses to return to his usual form.

### HIVE MIND ●●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Animal Ken

By opening her mind and spreading her consciousness out into the area around her, the Scion with this Boon can make contact with those of her chosen animal that are near, slipping into their minds and experiencing the world through their senses as she pleases. Once she has spent the activation cost, the Scion may simultaneously perceive through the senses of all specimens of her chosen animal within a radius equal to her successes in miles, tasting, seeing, feeling and otherwise experiencing everything they do. While she cannot truly control them while thus spread out, she can cause them to search for specific things that she might be looking for, potentially turning a forest full of squirrels or a kennel full of dogs into her own squad of investigators. She may choose to inhabit as many or as few animals as she wishes, and she may remain a part of their senses for as long as she remains in the area or until she chooses to disengage of her own accord.

### ANIMAL FORM ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per transformation

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon may transform completely into a normal specimen of her chosen animal. This transformation takes place at will whenever the Scion desires; the animal in question appears perfectly normal to unaugmented eyes, and the Scion retains her mental attributes, Epic Attributes and Knacks while thus transformed but cannot access any of her normal physical or social powers.

### NATURAL ARMY ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per transformation

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon may transform into a number of normal specimens of his chosen animal equal to his body weight (minimum of 5). The animals produced share a hive mind and the Scion is able to direct them all as if he were only one creature instead of many. The animals in question appear perfectly normal to unaugmented eyes, and the Scion retains his mental Attributes, Epic Attributes and Knacks while thus transformed but cannot access any of his normal physical or social powers. The Scion may transform into the animals and back at any time, as long as one of the animals remains alive and conscious. Obviously, this power is only useful for Scions whose chosen animals are smaller than themselves, and does not work for others; a Scion’s chosen animal must weigh a maximum of one-fifth of his weight (though weight-increasing powers such as Jotunblut or Unusual Alteration may make increase a Scion’s weight to make larger animals possible).

### CREATE ANIMAL ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend, 1 Willpower and 3 lethal damage per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken

After cutting herself, the Scion may create normal specimens of her chosen animal from her very blood, allowing them to spring fully-formed into being, ready to follow her commands. Once created, the creatures are permanent unless killed.

|Creatures |Units per Successes Rolled |
|---|---|
|Speck (ant, tick, seahorse) |100 |
|Tiny (grasshopper, hummingbird) |50 |
|Small (raven, housecat, badger) |10 |
|Modest (wolf, kangaroo, lynx) |2 |
|Normal (lion, dolphin, tiger) |1/2 |
|Large (horse, bear) |1/4 |
|Huge (elephant, great white shark) |1/6 |
|Enormous (whale, giant squid) |1/10 |
### PAPER TIGER ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 6 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Art

By creating a piece of art representing a specimen of his chosen animal (whether a painting, sculpture, carving, etc.), the Scion may then summon forth that animal from the artwork at any time as long as he pays one Legend to do so. Artwork thus created is considered a Relic and is extremely difficult to destroy until this boon is used, whereupon it loses its special properties and cannot be used for purposes of this boon again. The animal is a normal specimen of the Scion’s chosen creature, and once created is permanent unless killed.

|Creatures |Units per Successes Rolled |
|---|---|
|Speck (ant, tick, seahorse) |100 |
|Tiny (grasshopper, hummingbird) |50 |
|Small (raven, housecat, badger) |10 |
|Modest (wolf, kangaroo, lynx) |2 |
|Normal (lion, dolphin, tiger) |1/2 |
|Large (horse, bear) |1/4 |
|Huge (elephant, great white shark) |1/6 |
|Enormous (whale, giant squid) |1/10 |
### CREATE NEMEAN ANIMAL ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 6 Legend, 2 Willpower and 6 lethal damage per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken

Difficulty: (Creature’s highest physical Attribute) x (Desired Legend rating – 1)

After cutting herself, the Scion may create a Nemean specimen of her chosen animal from her very blood, allowing it to spring fully-formed into being, ready to follow her commands. Once created, the beast is permanent unless killed.

### EPIC ENHANCEMENT ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per roll

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Animal Ken

The Scion may enhance a normal specimen of his animal, granting it bonuses beyond its normal abilities and effectively turning it into a Legendary beast. The Scion must decide how many times he wishes to roll before activating the power; he cannot add rolls mid-use, and he can only enhance a given animal once. Once he has rolled, he may use his total successes to purchase any combination of enhancements as follows:

|Successes |Enhancement |
|---|---|
|1 Success |+1 to Ability, or Mental or Social Attribute |
|2 Successes |+1 to Accuracy, DV or Soaks |
|3 Successes |+1 to Dexterity, or Epic Mental or Social Attribute |
|4 Successes |+1 to Strength or Stamina, or increase size by 100% |
|5 Successes |+1 to Epic Physical Attribute |
|10 Successes |+1 to Legend rating (maximum of Scion’s Legend – 1) |
The Scion may not increase any given animal’s physical Attributes, accuracy, DV, soaks or damage (through any combination of enhancements) past five times the creature’s total Legend plus the number size increases he has applied to it, and may not increase any of its mental or social attributes past five times the creature’s Legend. While the Scion may normally only enhance normal, non-Legendary animals with this Boon, he may also use it once on a Birthright animal, even if it is already Legendary.

### NEMEAN SCROLL ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 12 Legend and 2 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Art

Difficulty: (Creature’s highest physical attribute) X (desired Legend rating – 1)

By creating a piece of art representing an enhanced specimen of his chosen animal (whether a painting, sculpture, carving, etc.), the Scion may then summon forth that animal from the artwork at any time as long as he pays one Legend to do so. The artwork created is considered a Relic and is extremely difficult to destroy until this boon is used, whereupon it loses its special properties and cannot be used for purposes of this boon again. The animal is a Nemean specimen of the Scion’s chosen creature, and is permanent unless killed.

### BESTIAL NATURE ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower dot per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By concentrating on her physical form and invoking the qualities of her favored creature, the Scion may take on select features permanently, becoming a hybrid of Scion and beast in truth. Whenever she chooses to add a feature, she may spend the requisite cost and replace part of her body with that of her animal, adding claws, wings, or even more bestial traits to her appearance; for every feature she chooses to take on she gains a permanent bonus of successes equal to her total number of Animal Boons to all uses of any one purview associated with that feature (for example, eagle claws that add to her use of War Boons or a bloodhound nose that adds to her use of Justice). The Scion may choose any purview that she can reasonably relate to a feature except for Animal, which can never receive a bonus from this Boon; she may add this bonus to Mystery, but doing so grants an equivalent number of dice instead of successes. The Scion may add as many features to herself as she wishes to pay Willpower for, but she may not use this Boon if her total number of Willpower dots is five or lower, as she doesn’t have the strength of will to force her body to change its substance so completely.

### HYBRID CHIMERA ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 10 – 25 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Animal Ken

Difficulty: (Animal’s Stamina) + (Second animal’s Stamina)

The Scion may combine different animals to create bizarre hybrids, flouting the laws of nature. For every success garnered in addition to the roll’s difficulty, the Scion creates one adult hybrid of her choice (hybrids are always evenly split between males and females; if the number of successes is odd, the extra creature is female). The exact abilities of any given hybrid must be agreed upon by the player and Storyteller. When creating a hybrid from two normal animals, the Scion must pay the 10 Legend cost; when crossing a normal animal with a hybrid, she must pay 15 Legend, and when combining two different hybrids she must pay the 20 Legend cost. Should she wish to combine animals that have previously been enhanced with the Jotunblut or Epic Enhancement Boons, she must pay 25 Legend to reflect the incredibly complicated natures of the creatures involved.

The Scion wishing to use this boon may use it to splice her chosen animal with any other; she does not require any Animal boons for the species she chooses to cross it with.

### PROTEAN UNDERSTANDING ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

No longer restricted to creatures only of his chosen type, the Scion may now apply his Animal Boons to any and all animals.

### TYPHONIAN ANIMAL ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 12 Legend, 3 Willpower and 12 lethal damage per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken

Difficulty: Varies (see below)

After cutting herself and bleeding divine ichor on a specimen of her chosen animal, the Scion may create truly awesome Typhonian beast from her very blood. During the ritual, the creature in question grows to one thousand times its size; all Physical Attributes are multiplied by the creature’s new Legend rating, as are its health boxes. It gains Epic Stamina and Strength equal to its (Legend – 1), has an Accuracy rating of its (Dexterity + 40), and gains an additional soak of 8 aggravated and 16 bashing and lethal. Once created, the creature is permanent unless killed.

|Successes |Beast’s Legend |
|---|---|
|20 Successes |Legend 9 |
|40 Successes |Legend 10 |
|60 Successes |Legend 11 |
|80 Successes |Legend 12 |
### THE BEAST
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion becomes the ultimate Beast, immune to traps and hunters, unshakable from trails, and destructive with a thought.
