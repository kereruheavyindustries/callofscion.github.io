### DEATH SENSES ●
**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this boon has a supernatural awareness of the dead and may see, hear, and smell ghosts and dead spirits as if they were alive; he may also determine the general cause of death if confronted with a corpse, though this information will be vague. He may turn this power on and off at will (and must announce to the GM that he is doing so).

### DELAY ROT ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Medicine

By touching a corpse, the Scion may perfectly preserve it, protecting it from the ravages of decay for a number of weeks equal to her successes; if the body is not otherwise protected, it will resume rotting at a normal rate once that time has expired.

### CORPSE ORACLE ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

The Scion with this boon may command even the dead to give up their secrets. For every three successes she receives on the activation roll, she may ask any ghost, corpse, or undead creature one question, which it will answer truthfully to the best of its ability. Undead creatures may roll to resist, but will believe themselves to be giving up the information willingly if they fail.

### EUTHANASIA ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

With a touch, the Scion may administer a merciful death to any incapacitated person or creature. Mortals and normal animals may be killed regardless of their wishes; creatures and people with Legend ratings must genuinely want to die in order for this power to be effective.

### DESTROY DEAD ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By touching any corpse, body part or other physical evidence of a dead being, the Scion may instantly and utterly destroy it, leaving behind nothing but dust and preventing anyone from using any Death Boons on it again. If a corpse is dismembered, only the part the Scion touches is destroyed, though he may stack the pieces together in order to destroy them all at once.

### UNQUIET CORPSE ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

The Scion with this boon may command the dead to rise and serve him, animating any corpse into a zombie that follows his orders to the best of its ability. The zombies thus raised continue to serve the Scion indefinitely, until they are destroyed or the Scion himself dies. Once the Scion has rolled, he may use his total successes to purchase any combination of enhancements (applied to the zombie template from Scion: Hero) as follows:

| Successes | Enhancement  |
|--------|--------|
| 1 Success | +1 Stamina |
| 2 Successes | +1 Strength |
| 3 Successes | +1 Dexterity or +1 Epic Stamina |
| 4 Successes | +1 Legend or +1 Epic Strength |
| 5 Successes | +1 Epic Dexterity |

The Scion’s new zombies may have a maximum number of points of Strength and Stamina equal to their Legend multiplied by 5.

### POLTERGEIST BEACON ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend, 1 Willpower and 1 lethal damage per use

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Occult

The Scion with this Boon may cause an enemy to become perpetually haunted by malevolent spirits, ruining their peace of mind and possibly even placing them in real danger. By placing a drop of her own blood somewhere on her target, the Scion makes the unlucky person into an irresistibly attractive beacon for poltergeists, angry ghosts and mischievous spirits, who will plague him or her incessantly with pranks, noises, and possibly even mildly harmful attacks, all of which may inflict a -4 distraction penalty on the target without warning. The beacon remains in effect for a number of weeks equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, after which point it fades and the ghosts are free to move on as they wish.

### SUMMON GHOST ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult

Provided that he has an item that once belonged to the spirit in question, or can make contact with a living relative, the Scion may summon a ghost to him. While the Scion may force the ghost to come to him if he overcomes its resistance roll, he cannot force it to do anything else without the use of other Death Boons.

### COMMAND THE SOUL ●●●●●
**Cost:** 5+ Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

Though most Scions who seek to master death have long ago learned the trick of creating mindless zombie servants to do their bidding, the Scion with this Boon now wields even greater power, becoming able to exert his control over all types of undead creatures, whether he created them or not. By spending the requisite cost (plus one additional point of Legend for every additional creature he wishes to affect, up to a maximum of his total number of Death Boons) and speaking to any undead being in a commanding voice, forcing it to recognize his authority over death, the Scion may cause it to obey his commands if it fails to resist him, becoming loyal to him as its rightful lord for the remainder of the scene. The undead creature, whether it be a zombie, mummy, ghost or other denizen of the beyond, retains any reasoning capacity and free will it might previously have had; it simply considers the Scion its lord and master for the rest of the scene and follows his instructions to the best of its ability. At the end of the scene, any undead thus enslaved by the Scion come to their senses, and he must convince them of his sovereignty anew if he wishes to continue to enjoy their obedience. If the Scion attempts to take control of an undead creature currently in the employ of another, he and the creature’s current controller make a contested roll of Charisma + Command; if the Scion wins, he retains unarguable control of the creature until his opponent spends to use this Boon and try to wrest it away again, and similarly, if he fails to overcome his opponent’s roll, he must use this Boon again for a second attempt.

### MOTHER’S TOUCH ●●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Now so attuned to the spirit world that she can move in and out of it herself, the Scion may touch and interact with ghosts as though they were corporeal and alive, even if they have not chosen to manifest physically; while this Boon is active, she is surrounded by a flickering black radiance, indicating her presence in both spheres. If she chooses to attack or otherwise interact with someone who is possessed by a ghost, she must roll separately for both the ghost and the mortal vessel it currently inhabits.

### BLEAK CENSUS ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Occult

The veil of death is an impenetrable wall of mystery, a barrier that no one may peek behind except for the Scion with this Boon. By naming or specifically describing any one person (the Scion must have a good idea of who he is searching for) and spending the requisite cost, the Scion instantly learns whether or not that person is among the dead. If this Boon reveals that the individual in question is, indeed, deceased, the Scion may ask one question about their death or current disposition or whereabouts among the dead for every five successes he gained on the activation roll. This Boon cannot answer questions having to do with what the individual did in life, nor can it answer questions having to do with their private thoughts or future; it can only provide information concerning their death and afterlife.

### EXORCISM ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult

The Scion with this boon may counteract the meddling of the dead, forcing them back whence they came. By touching a possessed person, he may force the possessing spirit out; likewise, he may banish a ghost back to the Underworld by touching its incorporeal flesh and overcoming its Strength + Athletics resistance roll (a ghost thus banished to the Underworld may not leave it again in any way for a number of days equal to his threshold successes). He may also force one dead or undead creature away from him for every three successes he receives on his activation roll, forcing ghosts to become incorporeal and all dead creatures to give him a berth equal to ten times his total number of Death Boons in yards for a number of hours also equal to his total number of Death Boons.

### HAUNTED MISTS ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By concentrating and becoming unmoving and inactive for a number of turns equal to half her total number of Death Boons, the Scion may create a thick mist around her, extending for yards equal to her Death Boons in every direction. Any ghosts caught in the mist are unable to leave, and become corporeal for the duration of the scene, giving them both the power to affect their environment and, in turn, the power to be affected.

### SHAMBLING HORDE ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult

The dead now rise at the Scion’s command, even if he does not have the time to specifically dedicate his attention to each one of them. By calling out to the dead and spending the requisite cost, the Scion may cause a number of corpses up to his total number of Death Boons to rise at his command as zombie minions, mindless and under his complete control as if they had been raised individually with the Unquiet Corpse Boon. He may divide his successes in order to decide their capabilities exactly as in the Unquiet Corpse Boon, and his choices are applied to all of the risen zombies instead of just to one. The Scion may only raise zombies if there are enough dead bodies nearby to answer his call; if not, he will be able to raise only as many as are available.

### OPEN UNDERWORLD PORTAL ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Dexterity + Occult

The Scion with this Boon may go directly to the realm of death itself, opening a portal to a relatively safe area in his own pantheon’s Underworld. He may bring a number of others along with him equal to his successes, but any creature with a Legend rating of less than 3 that accompanies him will remain trapped there as a ghost. If he wishes to travel to another pantheon’s Underworld, he may do so instead, but at an additional +10 difficulty to his roll. If the Scion owns an area within an underworld and travels directly to it, he may take twice as many people with him as he would normally be able to.

### GHOST CONTROL ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult

Provided that she has an item that once belonged to the spirit in question and was harvested from the ghost’s body within 24 hours of its death, the Scion may issue commands to a ghost which it has no choice but to obey. She may speak any commands into the item, which instantly transmits them to the ghost; likewise, any communication from the ghost whispers from the memento for the Scion’s ears only. Should the ghost succeed in resisting the Scion’s commands, it will still be required to complete its orders, but it may intentionally pervert or undermine the spirit and goal of those orders while still nominally obeying. If she wishes, the Scion may place the item into a corpse and spend two points of Legend to bind the ghost to that body, causing it to rise as a Hungry Corpse; if she can induce a mortal to swallow the item, she may spend two points of Legend to allow the ghost to possess the mortal’s body, remaining in control of it until the item passes. Whenever the ghost is in actual danger, its item begins to glow with a faint warmth, alerting the Scion to its peril; if it is destroyed, the item vanishes as well. If at any time she wishes to force her ghost to manifest, the Scion may spend three points of Legend; when she does so, the ghost becomes fully solid and corporeal for the remainder of the scene, and must interact with the material world. Should the Scion no longer wish to retain the ghost as a servant, she may devour the item that binds it to her, destroying the spirit in order to gain five Legend points; if she does not, it remains a focal binding point for the ghost for a number of years equal to the Scion’s total number of Death Boons multiplied by the number of years the ghost lived its mortal life. If the Scion retains the ghost’s services for one full year, she may gain ten Legend points from devouring its item, provided that she did not at any point during that time release the ghost’s tie to it. Only the ghosts of mortals may be thus harnessed; those with Legend continue to be subject to the whims of Fate even after death, and may not be chained by any Scion.

### REVENANT ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Command

No longer limited to mindless drudges, the Scion with this boon may command the dead to rise and serve him as thinking, intelligent servants, creating undead creatures with their souls intact. The creatures thus created may be in any undead form the Scion considers appropriate (mummies, intelligent zombies, etc.) and continue to serve him loyally and indefinitely upon being created, until they are destroyed or the Scion himself dies. Once the Scion has rolled, he may use his total successes to purchase any combination of enhancements (applied to the Hungry Corpse template from Scion: Hero) as follows:

| Successes | Enhancement  |
|--------|--------|
| 1 Success | +1 physical Attribute |
| 2 Successes | +1 mental Attribute |
| 3 Successes | +1 social Attribute |
| 4 Successes | +1 Legend or +1 physical Epic Attribute |
| 5 Successes | +1 social or mental Epic Attribute |

The Scion’s newly-created minions may never have an Epic Attribute higher than is proscribed by their Legend rating or mundane Attributes, and they may never possess a higher Legend rating than one lower than the Scion’s own.

### DEATH OF THE SOUL ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 20 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Strength + Occult

The Scion with this Boon has such control over mortality that he may inflict it even on the gods themselves. If the Scion is successful in overcoming his target’s automatic Stamina + Fortitude roll, the god, demigod or other lesser immortal in question becomes mortal for an amount of time (if the target is Legend 1-4, days; if they are Legend 5-8, minutes, and for those Legend 9 and above, turns) equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, losing access to all their godly powers and enhancements. The target may pay two points of Legend and a point of Willpower to reduce the duration of his or her mortality by one unit (and may do so as many times as he or she is willing to pay for). This power cannot be used on gods who are Avatar form, and can never be used on Titan Avatars.

### STRIKE DEAD/DENY DEATH ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult

The Scion with this Boon has the ultimate power over life and death, and may instantly cause the death of any creature of Legend 8 or lower provided she overcomes their Stamina + Fortitude roll. She may also, at her discretion, command the dead to rise again, resurrecting a fallen creature or comrade from the grave; to do so, the body of the target must be intact, and someone must heal it of at least one level of damage or the target will simply die again upon resurrection. Resurrecting a fallen person or creature can only be done within a number of minutes equal to or less than the Scion’s successes on the activation roll, and takes an amount of time equal to the length of time that the corpse in question has been dead, after which point it rises to live again.

### THE REAPER
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion becomes the embodiment of death, instantly killing mortals and gods and even affecting titans and avatars.
