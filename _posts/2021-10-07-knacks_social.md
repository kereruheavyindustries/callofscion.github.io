### ATTENTION PLEASE
Prerequisite: Preach On

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

No matter how noisy, crowded or confusing things might be, everyone hears the Scion with this Knack when she wishes to be heard. Whenever she chooses to spend the requisite cost, everyone within her range of vision (though not necessarily her line of sight – those in a house she could see, for example, would hear her even if they were inside and out of sight) automatically hears her when she speaks for the rest of the scene.

### BELIEVE YOUR OWN PRESS
Prerequisite: BFF

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is so skilled at bolstering his companions’ spirits and lightening their hearts that he can’t help but feel good about himself in turn. Whenever he uses a Knack that grants Willpower to another person, he may gain one point of Willpower himself as he basks in the contact high of inspiring others.

### BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By flashing a smile or letting the force of her personality simply wash over a person, the Scion with this Knack may influence their credulity; as long as she makes a specific effort to encourage someone to believe her, the person in question does their very best to grant her the benefit of the doubt as to whether or not it is true, even if she would reject it from any other, less charismatic source. If the Scion is required to roll to make her story be believed, she may roll Charisma + Empathy instead of Manipulation + Empathy.

### BFF
Prerequisite: Blessing of Importance

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

No stranger to socializing, the Scion with this Knack is simply so engaging and enjoyable to be around that the very act of treating someone else like a friend bolsters them, making them feel better by association. By speaking a kind word, acting chummy, or otherwise treating someone else as a comrade, the Scion may refill their entire Willpower pool as their self-worth experiences a temporary boost. If he chooses to use this power on a mortal, the Scion may additionally grant them an extra point of Willpower past their usual maximum, which remains until spent; once the mortal has spent all his or her Willpower points, they are automatically refilled one more time by the lingering effects of the Scion’s goodwill. This Knack may only be used on a single target once per day.

### BLESSING OF IMPORTANCE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By reminding a target of their importance in the overall scheme of things, the Scion with this Knack may bolster flagging spirits and bring renewed determination to his allies. By spending the requisite cost and giving his subject a compliment or miniature pep talk, he may restore a number of their Willpower points equal to his number of Epic Charisma dots; if he chooses to bestow this largesse upon a mortal, the lucky recipient regains his or her entire Willpower pool, buoyed by divine encouragement. This Knack may only be used on a single target once per day.

### BORROWED CREDIBILITY
Prerequisite: Unimpeachable Reference

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Academics

Sometimes the best way to convince someone of something is to let someone else do it. If the Scion with this Knack wishes to let someone else take center stage – whether to give them their moment in the sun, avoid undue notice herself, or even put them on the spot for any potential backlash – she may choose to temporarily lend them her own charismatic flair, giving them her godly force of engaging personality for any social rolls they attempt. She must instruct her target in exactly how she wishes for them to speak or behave in a given situation; she might explain how to convince castle guards to let them inside, or how to behave at tea with the queen. Once she has done so, for a number of days equal to the Scion’s successes, her target may add the Scion’s automatic successes from Epic Charisma instead of their own to all non-activation Charisma rolls he or she makes that follow the Scion’s instructions. Should the target attempt to use this Knack’s power in a situation not specifically covered by the Scion’s instructions, or in an attempt to intentionally work against the Scion in some way, it does not work and he or she finds that only his or her natural Charisma is at work.

### BOYS WILL BE BOYS
Prerequisite: Charmer

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Politics

It’s impossible to remain angry with the Scion who possesses this Knack; he simply won’t let you. By spending the requisite point of Legend and making some disingenuous comment, gesture, or even just a cheeky grin, the Scion communicates that sometimes these things just happen, and convinces those faced with him to laugh it off without the anger or need to pursue consequences they might normally feel, letting him get off scot-free (or at least with minimal punishment) for even the most rambunctious of misbehavior. Those whose family members or close friends the Scion has outright injured or otherwise hurt may gain bonuses when rolling to resist this power. Though convincing those without a Legend rating is a simple matter of a single point of Legend, averting the wrath of more powerful creatures is more difficult, and requires the Scion to spend an amount of Legend equal to half his Epic Charisma dots when he uses this Knack.

### CALM THE SAVAGE
Prerequisite: Crowd Control

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Empathy

The Scion with this Knack has a presence so powerful that it may calm the most ferocious of creatures and give the most determined of heroes pause when she decides to exercise it. Once this power is activated, the Scion’s influence extends around her in every direction for a distance equal to five times her total number of Epic Charisma dots in yards, and anyone within that radius will find it next to impossible to take aggressive action or even to insult another person or idea. Those affected may spend a point of Willpower once per minute in order to add successes to an extended resistance roll against the Scion’s successes in an attempt to shake off the knack’s effects.

### CHARMER
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Presence

The Scion with this Knack can simply turn on the charm, enhancing his friendly and enjoyable presence immensely. Those interacting with him are inclined to treat him fondly and help him if they are able, though they will not act in a manner dangerous or uncomfortable for themselves. Friends become his devoted allies, neutral parties become bosom companions, and even enemies are inclined to look on him with an unprejudiced eye. If at any point the Scion injures someone else while using this Knack, all those who witness his action may immediately make another resistance roll as they may be shocked into breaking free of his influence. At the end of the Scene, the Scion’s increased likeability fades and any repressed emotions in those nearby surge back at full intensity.

### CROWD CONTROL
Prerequisite: Charmer

**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Presence

By speaking a few soothing phrases or just letting herself be a calming presence in the scene, the Scion with this Knack may calm the hysteria of others. After spending the requisite cost, she may calm a large group of people from the heights of panic or violent mob-mentality, returning them to normalcy and reason; she may affect up to three people for every success she gains on a Charisma + Presence roll. Should another Scion attempt to seize control of the crowd’s emotions with an opposing power, the two must make an opposed Charisma + Presence roll. The Scion may only use this Knack on beings of Legend less than or equal to half her own (rounded up).

### DIVINE FIGUREHEAD
Prerequisite: Pied Piper

**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Presence

Exuding divine charisma from his very pores, the Scion with this Knack may cause an instant party, riot, rave, or event to spring up around him. Everyone within his general area is susceptible to suddenly deciding to initiate an event or celebration around him, abandoning whatever else they might have been doing, unaware that this is anything but their own idea. Mortals fall instantly and completely under the Scion’s spell, while even divine beings must resist or find themselves equally swept up (and even those who do resist still feel an inclination to find the Scion and participate, though they are no longer forced to do so). The revelry continues for a number of days equal to the Scion’s Charisma; during this time, no one involved need rest, but when the sun rises and his spell is broken all involved become immediately exhausted from the effort.

### ENGENDER LOVE
Prerequisite: Snap Out of It

**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Presence

Now able to tug on her target’s very heartstrings, the Scion with this Knack may literally cause others to fall in love with her. If she successfully overcomes her target’s resistance, they fall instantly, hopelessly, and completely in love with her for a number of days equal to her threshold successes. The target retains free will and may act on his or her own for the duration, but will still do his or her best to make the Scion happy and earn his or her love (possibly even via violent means); after the allotted time has run out, they will instantly return to whatever emotion they felt toward the Scion before this Knack was used, and will retain full knowledge and memory of the time while they were under her sway.

### FILIBUSTER
Prerequisite: Preach On

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Presence

As any good politician knows, just saying what you want to say is half the battle, and the Scion with this Knack always has that down pat. As long as she does not pause in her speech for more than give seconds, she may speak without interruption for as long as she wishes, making truly epic speeches, tirades, and declarations possible. Anyone wishing to interrupt her in any manner, including leaving before the speech has concluded, must spend one point of Willpower and make a contested roll against the Scion’s successes. Any being within earshot of the acting Scion may make this roll reflexively at the beginning of the speech.

### FINAL COUNTDOWN
Prerequisite: Never Say Die

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Sometimes encouragement just isn’t quite enough. The Scion with this Knack knows how to turn defeat into victory, and exercises his charismatic abilities to aid his fellow warriors just when the going gets tough. Any time that the Scion is about to lose consciousness and uses Never Say Die, he may also spend the Legend cost for Final Countdown in order to give any others in the scene a number of bonus dice for their next action equal to his Epic Charisma auto-successes.

### FREEZE OUT
Prerequisite: BFF

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

Just as a Scion with Epic Charisma can cause those around him to be haplessly enraptured by his charm, so too can he wield that social influence against others with a thought. By spending the requisite Legend cost and making a dismissive gesture, mouthing an insult, or even simply snubbing a person, the Scion with this Knack ensures that they will be totally socially ostracized for a number of days equal to his threshold successes (his target resists with an opposed Charisma + Command roll). If the unfortunate target is an important figure or leader, he will suddenly find his people less cooperative and his ranks full of gossip and disrespect; if he’s just some schmuck on the street, he’ll find himself outright shunned and reviled wherever he goes.

### HAPLESS COOL
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

No matter what the Scion does or how many things he fails at, if he has this Knack he maintains an aura of cool suavity. He may also activate this power reflexively if the he wishes to mitigate the social effects of a mistake or accident when it happens.

### INSPIRATIONAL FIGURE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By giving a short inspirational speech or encouraging monologue, the Scion with this Knack may fill her listeners with a renewed sense of hope and purpose. Any mortal she wishes who is actively listening to her recitation regains one point of Willpower (though this may not increase anyone’s Willpower pool past their usual maximum); listeners must also be able to speak the same language or otherwise understand the Scion’s speech in order to benefit from it.

### INSTANT SEMINAR
Prerequisite: Inspirational Figure

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is so inspiring that he fills others with the urge to learn from his example, making him an excellent teacher while he remains with his pupil. By giving a short explanation, he may impart one of his abilities to as many mortal students in his area as he wishes for the remainder of the scene, in place of their own prowess in that skill; at Hero level, he may impart three dots of an ability, whereas at Demigod he may share five and at God he may bestow a full seven. He can only provide additional knowledge if he has it; students who are already more skilled than the Scion in a given ability cannot gain any new knowledge from this Knack.

### NATURAL LEADER
Prerequisite: Inspirational Figure

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Some people are simply born gifted leaders of men, and the Scion with this Knack knows instinctively what to say, when to say it, and how to use it to the best effect. The experience cost for her to learn the Animal Ken, Art, Command, and Presence abilities is halved.

### NEVER SAY DIE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack knows how to keep his comrades going even when things look grim; by giving them an encouraging smile, gesture, or shout just when he has been knocked off his feet, he keeps their morale up, restoring a number of points of Willpower equal to the damage he has just taken to any comrades within range. He may use this power only once per scene, when he has been struck in combat and knocked down, and he may not give anyone Willpower beyond their normal maximum, but he may use it as often as these conditions are met, and may even activate it reflexively as he is knocked unconscious.

### PARAGON OF VIRTUE
Prerequisite: Instant Seminar

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By giving a short spiel or rousing speech on one of her Virtues, the Scion with this Knack may cause others to feel it as well, encouraging them to follow her in her course of action. Any mortals listening when she activates this Knack immediately gain her full pool of the Virtue in question for the rest of the scene, while beings with a Legend rating gain one point in the Virtue, whether or not they would normally possess it.

### PEAK PERFORMANCE
Prerequisite: Theme Music

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

The Scion with this Knack is so impressive that it is nearly impossible to compete with him when it comes to showmanship. Whenever he chooses to spend the requisite point of Legend, the Scion may perform an action that is so impressively executed that anyone else who saw him do it suffers from extreme insecurity when attempting to do the same thing afterward, losing a number of successes from their attempts to do so equal to the difference between the Scion’s Epic Charisma successes and their own as they realize that the Scion’s action was so magnificent that they couldn’t possibly measure up. This only applies to the specific action in question (i.e., the lifting of a particular rock, not the lifting of all rocks everywhere), and this Knack may only be used in non-combat situations; competitions, speeches, or the creation of art, for example, are all perfect arenas in which the Scion may demonstrate his effortless superiority.

### PIED PIPER
Prerequisite: Crowd Control

**Cost:** 1 Legend + 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Like the legendary figure from which this Knack takes its name, a Scion that possesses it is catnip to mortals, amassing an adoring following over a short period of time once he has activated it. Mortals that see him (in person; this Knack does not work remotely) will instantly abandon what they are doing and follow him happily wherever he goes for a number of days equal to his Charisma (though they will not put themselves in harm’s way); they require no rest while doing so, but once the Scion’s influence wears off they become exhausted by their exertions. This Knack always ends exactly at sunrise.

### PREACH ON
Prerequisite: Inspirational Figure

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack surpasses even the most skilled of mortal orators, able to fill her listeners with renewed purpose and brimming verve. By giving a speech of a suitably heroic nature and spending the requisite Legend cost, she may restore the full Willpower pool of any listening mortals, as well as granting them one additional point of Willpower above their usual maximum, which remains until it is spent.

### SNAP OUT OF IT
Prerequisite: Charmer

**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

When things look darkest and his comrades have been overwhelmed by supernatural forces, the Scion with this Knack can get them back on their feet, inspiring them to drag themselves back into action for a little while just for him. By performing some action to capture his target’s attention (slapping, shaking or just screaming, “Pull yourself together, man!”) and spending the requisite cost, the Scion may attempt to snap his target out of any mental or social power that is currently rendering them inactive. If he overcomes the successes scored by the user of the power with his own, his target immediately becomes free. The Scion may only use this Knack to snap others out of effects that render them inactive; he can temporarily restore sense to someone afflicted with Crawling Chaos, but he cannot stop someone suffering from Engender Love from continuing in their devotion to the object of their affections.

### THEME MUSIC
Prerequisite: Hapless Cool

**Cost:** 2 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

Some people are just so pervasive that when you hear a certain song, you instantly think of them. The Scion with this Knack is one of those people, and there is a specific song that is associated with her that just seems to pop up anywhere she goes. If there is a radio, chamber orchestra, elevator loudspeaker, or any other music-playing agency nearby, the Scion may spend the Legend cost to cause it to start playing her chosen song, which will continue playing in a loop until she wishes it to stop. While the song is playing, the Scion may add her auto-successes from Charisma as extra dice to all Charisma, Manipulation or Appearance rolls, and, should she attempt a stunt that is thematically appropriate to the song playing, that stunt will receive double its normal number of bonus dice. Due to the constant reminder of the Scion’s divine (or just really awesome) presence, however, all Fatebinding rolls pertaining to her will be at a difficulty of -1 while the song is playing.

Changing one’s theme music is extremely difficult, so Scions are advised to think carefully on their choice; once chosen, the song can only be changed when more Fatebound people or worshipers of the Scion associate the new song with her than the old one, at which point she may spend 5 points of Legend to make the change permanent. However, this knack may be purchased more than once, so it is possible for a Scion to have several different theme songs to choose from.

### UNIMPEACHABLE REFERENCE
Prerequisite: Benefit of the Doubt

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command

Instead of taking point for every problem, the Scion with this Knack may step back and let someone else do the talking for a change, surreptitiously lending them his support. By spending the requisite cost, he may impart to a target the ability to use his own formidable Charisma for a number of days equal to his successes, temporarily giving them his own power to encourage credulity in others. In order to ensure that his target is believed, the Scion must either personally vouch for him in the presence of the person he wishes to convince or otherwise give him some recognizable token to show that he comes in the Scion’s name; thereafter, the target may at any time invoke the Scion to use his successes from Epic Charisma instead of her own when making non-activation Charisma rolls to specifically carry out the Scion’s orders or acting in his interests. The target must spend one point of Willpower each time he or she calls upon the Scion’s Charisma in this way.

### WIDESPREAD APPEAL
Prerequisite: Benefit of the Doubt

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is so effortlessly likeable, impressive or intimidating that she evokes an instant mob mentality in those around her, allowing her to treat them as a single being, united in their awe of her. She may spend the requisite cost to attempt to convince any number of people in a single scene of something as if using the Benefit of the Doubt Knack on each one.

### EMINENT LIKABILITY
Prerequisite: Charmer

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The best defense is a good offense. This Scion’s force of personality is so strong that anyone who attempts to exert influence over him has to first work through the influence he has on them. He may add his dots in Charisma to his MDV. This Knack may only stack with two other Tier 2 resistance Knacks.

### UNTOUCHABLE PRESENCE
Prerequisite: Eminent Likability

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Even the most convicted or begrudging of Gods or Titan-kin are unable to help the healthy respect they have for the Scion’s utter strength of self and personhood. She may use her automatic successes in Epic Charisma instead of Legend when calculating MDV. This Knack does not stack with Weaver of Webs, Disorienting Countenance, Audit Self, Parapet of the Mind, or Crazy Like a Fox.

### ADVANTAGEOUS CIRCUMSTANCES
Prerequisite: Trendsetter

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Politics

The Scion with this Knack leads a charmed existence when she wishes to. By spending the requisite Legend and taking some action, however small and unrelated, she may inform the Storyteller of a desired outcome of the situation (“I want to meet that waitress,” or “I want this gun to end up in Joseph’s hand”) and watch as events align and fall into place like dominos, leading directly to that effect. She may not have any idea how events will unfold to get her what she wants, but she may rest secure in the knowledge that they will do so. This Knack generally only bends mortals into unwittingly achieving the Scion’s goal; if she finds herself in a situation wherein Legendary beings are available to do so, she must gain more successes than their combined Legend ratings.

### BLAME JAMES
Prerequisite: Not the Face

**Cost:** 2 Legend

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy

By putting on her best innocent face, the Scion with this Knack may not only convince a target that she is blameless in a specific situation but redirect their ire to a new person entirely. By activating this Knack, she may do some fast talking to claim that another nearby person is to blame for a particular infraction, and her clever machinations and misdirections will ensure that she is believed by her target.

### BLURT IT OUT
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy

The Scion with this Knack has no patience for liars or those who may wish to give him the runaround. By spending the requisite amount of Legend and asking a direct question, he may cause the target of his interest to suddenly blurt out the answer as truthfully as possible, whether or not they might wish to do so.

### COMMANDMENT
Prerequisite: Trendsetter

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Not content with the usual rise and fall of interest among mortals and gods, the Scion with this Knack may extend rumors and fads until they become facts of life, altering the very fabric of the societies around her. Whenever she uses the Rumor Mill or Trendsetter Knacks, she may spend this Knack’s cost to extend their effects; one point of Legend spent extends the Knack’s duration from weeks to years, three points extends it to decades and five points extends it to centuries, making the Scion’s phenomenon an enduring part of life.

### DEPROGRAMMING
Prerequisite: Mass Hypnosis

**Cost:** 1+ Legend

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Presence

Sometimes reversing a power is much more important than laying down the law with a new one, and the Scion with this Knack knows how to undo the most soundly entrenched of meddlings. If the Scion knows that a subject has been affected by some form of mind-altering or influencing Knack or Boon, she may reverse it, provided that she possesses the same power herself, spends the same number of additional Legend points as the being who originally laid it on her target, and overcomes their activation successes. A target thus relieved of an affliction is instantly restored to their normal frame of mind.

### EXTENDED INFLUENCE
Prerequisite: Secondhand Persuasion

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is so perfectly attuned to others that she can get her point across no matter how she has to communicate it. She may spend this Knack’s cost along with any other Manipulation Knack’s in order to use it in spite of the usual restriction that requires her to speak directly to her target; whether she manipulates her target via sign language, telepathic nudging or even via long-range radio or television broadcasts, if her target can understand her, the Manipulation Knack may be used on them as normal.

### GOD’S HONEST
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy

With a simple wave of his hand and an affirming phrase, the Scion with this Knack may wipe away doubt in the mind of his target. As long as he appends a reassuring phrase (such as “I promise,” or “Scout’s honor”) to his statement, he may cause his target to do their very best to believe what he says, even if it would normally seem completely far-fetched. Targets must roll to resist this Knack as normal; if they fail to overcome the Scion’s successes, they cannot roll Perception + Empathy to attempt to detect the falsehood he is shamelessly perpetrating and are forced to simply believe what he says.

### HARD SELL
Prerequisite: Overt Order

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Command

The Scion with this Knack is able give commands in such a way that they are impossible to ignore, even for a large group of people. By spending the requisite cost and giving a simple command, he may force any people within his earshot who understand the command to instantly obey (though it’s likely they may be very upset about this use of force afterward). He may command only a number of people up to his successes, may only give them a short sentence command, and must be audible and understandable in order for them to obey (he cannot give commands via electronic means or in unfamiliar languages).

### IMPLANT FALSE MEMORY
Prerequisite: Who, Me?

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy

As long as she has first used the Instant Hypnosis Knack on someone, the Scion with this Knack may take things a step further and actually implant a fabricated memory into her victim’s mind, causing them to staunchly believe in events that never actually occurred. Such a memory seems perfectly real to the hypnotized subject, and cannot be removed except by use of the Deprogramming Knack.

### INSTANT HYPNOSIS
Prerequisite: Overt Order

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Command

By making eye contact with his target and maintaining it for a few seconds, the Scion with this power may lay the seeds for his own future control, unknown to even the target himself. By spending the requisite cost, the Scion may implant a simple command in his target’s mind to be triggered later, allowing him to be far away or seemingly uninvolved in events when they actually play out. Even if the target fails to resist the Scion’s subliminal command, if it is an abhorrent act or otherwise flies in the face of a staunch belief, she may make one last attempt to deny it at the moment before it activates, rolling her Wits + Integrity against a difficulty of the Scion’s Legend rating.

### KILL THE MESSENGER
Prerequisite: Blurt It Out

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Academics

One of the greatest powers of manipulation is the ability to have someone else do your dirty work for you; the Scion with this Knack knows just how to get that accomplished, even if her accomplice is less than proficient in the persuasive arts. She may explain to her target exactly how to manipulate others to his best advantage; as long as her target follows her instructions, he may add her successes from Epic Manipulation to his own rolls of that attribute, buttressed by borrowed knowledge of what strings to pull in his targets. The target retains the benefits of this Knack for a number of days equal to the Scion’s successes, but may only use it in situations specifically provided for by the Scion; if he attempts to use it in a situation not covered by the Scion’s instructions, or in an attempt to work against the Scion’s best interests, it fails to work.

### KNOWING GLANCE
Prerequisite: Stench of Guilt

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Presence

Angering the Scion with this Knack is a dangerous proposition; if he believes that he someone might be keeping a secret, all he need do is make eye contact and spend the requisite Legend cost to let his target know it. The target is immediately drained of Willpower points as he or she is afflicted with the knowledge that someone knows his or her terrible secret; the Scion need not know what that secret is or why the target is hiding it, but the target him- or herself is nevertheless tortured by a conviction that someone has discovered it. If by some chance the target is totally innocent of keeping any secrets (guilty secrets, that is – mundane secrets such as surprises planned for loved ones or unspoken crushes are unaffected by this Knack), however, nothing happens and the Scion has simply wasted his point of Legend. This Knack only functions against those who have equal or less Epic Manipulation than does the Scion; others are simply too good at misdirection for the Scion to beat them at their own game.

### MASS HYPNOSIS
Prerequisite: Instant Hypnosis

**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Command

Rather than convincing her subjects one at a time, the Scion with this Knack may bring an entire group of people under her sway at one time. She may implant one subliminal command in up to as many people as she gains successes, though multiple commands will require multiple uses.

### NOT THE FACE
Prerequisite: Opening Act

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy

By cringing, feinting, or otherwise letting his opponent know that he does not wish to be hit, the Scion with this Knack may force them to hesitate, giving him enough time to run for it or take some other action without fear of being struck. Whenever he is attacked in combat and is about to be struck, he may cower and reflexively activate this power, causing his attacker hesitate for a second; the Scion must make his cringe or cower a stunt in some manner, however, or it will not be sufficiently impressive to stop an attacker bent on his demise. The attacker can then chose another action to take, but it can not be a violent act aimed at the Scion; after that, he is free to act as he chooses once again. The Scion may use this Knack on the same opponent more than once per scene, but each time he does so causes its Legend cost to increase by one.

### OBLITERATION
Prerequisite: Who, Me?

**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Politics

The Scion is now so skilled at meddling with the memories of others that she can completely erase herself from them, giving her immunity to the recriminations or investigation of others. Whenever she chooses to pay the requisite cost for this Knack, the Scion becomes completely unrememberable for the remainder of the scene; no matter what she does, be it destroying an important artifact, insulting a powerful god or even killing a comrade, those who witnessed the deed will find themselves completely unable to remember her doing it after the fact. Those with whom the Scion did not directly interact do not remember that anyone was there at all; those whom the Scion specifically interacted with, even to the point of physically assaulting someone, will remember that the interaction occurred but be completely at a loss as to who it was that performed it. This memory loss is permanent and cannot be counteracted by any means except for other Manipulation Knacks; nothing the Scion did during the scene can be remembered or traced back to her by anyone else who was there. Witnesses may roll Intelligence + Politics against the Scion’s successes; if they succeed, they may remember the scene’s details in full, but if they fail find themselves helpless to identify the shadowy figure of their memories.

### OPENING ACT
Prerequisite: Seductive Mien

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Misdirection is the bread and butter of many a manipulative Scion, and sometimes that includes taking a fall in order to see that his goals are ultimately realized. Whenever he chooses to pay this Knack’s activation cost, the Scion may intentionally perform an action so poorly that it makes the next person to perform it after him look that much better, granting his Epic Manipulation successes as dice to their roll. This Knack may only be used in non-combat situations such as contests, conversations or artistic endeavors, allowing the Scion to stealthily aid his comrades through his sheer ability to look completely inept.

### OVERT ORDER
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Command

The Scion with this Knack simply forces others to do as she wishes, autocratically or more subtly by embedding the command within a larger sentence. When she activates this power, she may give one simple command which her target must obey if they fail to resist.

### RETURN TO SENDER
Prerequisite: Kill the Messenger

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Manipulation is all about making the best use of the resources at the Scion’s command, and those resources are usually in the form of people he can send on his errands and bend to do his bidding. Whenever the Scion with this Knack uses Epic Manipulation or one of its Knacks to send someone on an errand, he may also spend for this power in order to force his subject to return to him once the job has been completed, giving them an exact place to meet once they have completed their goal. Should the Scion fail to show up for this rendezvous, his target is immediately freed from this Knack’s effects and may once again choose to go where he pleases. This Knack also cannot force a person to risk their life in order to meet with the Scion, and can be ignored if doing so would mean certain death.

### RUMOR MILL
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Politics

Dropping a suggestive hint in someone’s ear is all it takes for the Scion with this Knack, a master of subtlety, to set off the equivalent of a social or cultural bomb. By spending the Legend cost and casually mentioning a suspicion or idea to any bystander, the Scion may start a tidal wave of gossip and rumors among as many people as she gains successes. While she may only start that many people talking, rumors are rumors; odds are, they’ll pass it on to others of their own accord, and she may find that she’s created a sensation that spreads in scope according to the following table:

| Successes | Rumor’s Range  |
|--------|--------|
| 1 | Everyone in the neighborhood |
| 5 | Everyone in the city |
| 15 | Everyone in the urban areas of the region |
| 20 | Everyone in the urban areas of the country |
| 30 | Everyone in the country |
| 35 | Everyone in the hemisphere |
| 45 | Everyone in the World |
| 50 | Everyone in non-closed Terrae Incognita |
| 60 or more | Everyone in the Overworlds and Underworlds |

The rumor continues to spread outward for a number of days equal to the Scion’s successes, and lasts for a number of weeks equal to his Epic Manipulation successes.

### SECONDHAND PERSUASION
Prerequisite: Kill the Messenger

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Now so impressive in his manipulative skills that he is impossible to resist even indirectly, the Scion with this Knack may use his Epic Manipulation rolls and Knacks through the written word, affecting anyone who reads his missive as if he had spoken the command aloud. The Scion may name a specific target upon whom the message will specifically work, but he need not unless he wishes to; if he does not, the next person to read the message will be affected by it, regardless of the Scion’s original intent. Once the message has been read and the Scion’s manipulation has taken effect through it, it becomes only a normal piece of writing again; if he wishes, however, the Scion may spent a permanent dot of Willpower to cause the message to remain permanently convincing, affecting others no matter how many times it is read.

### SEDUCTIVE MIEN
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Presence

A Scion with this Knack knows that the fastest way to someone’s heart is generally through their reproductive organs. As long as the Scion spends at least five minutes in conversation and interaction with her subject, her ability to vamp is so great that she may then make a contested roll to attempt to seduce them, regardless of her appearance, demeanor, or any other information that might normally make her less than desirable. Once per person per day, the Scion may overcome all their natural objections or disinclination and successfully seduce them; if she does, they remain positively disposed toward her even after the act, unable to realize that they have been duped for at least one hour due to the overwhelming attraction she has fooled them into.

### STENCH OF GUILT
Prerequisite: Takes One to Know One

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

So attuned to the art of deception is the Scion with this Knack that he knows instantly if someone is trying to hide something from him in conversation, even if they are not outright lying. While he doesn’t necessarily know what’s being hidden from him, he will always get the sense that something is, and be able to act accordingly. This Knack only affects targets with less than or equal the Scion’s Epic Manipulation.

### SUB ROSA
Prerequisite: Mass Hypnosis

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The most effective manipulations are usually the subtlest, and the Scion with this Knack has elevated that subtlety to an art form. Any time that he uses any other Manipulation Knack, he may spend the Legend cost to subliminally instruct the subject to do something other than what it appears he has ordered him to do. For example, a Scion with an ulterior motive might instruct someone to “Eat this chocolate cake,” and then be able to claim total innocence when the man, acting on his unspoken command of “Kill Timmy for me,” turns and murders his neighbor instead of chowing down. Anyone who overhears the Scion’s initial command and is able to overcome his successes on a Perception + Empathy roll is able to realize the truth of the matter.

### TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE
Prerequisite: God’s Honest

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is a liar through and through, and consequently always knows instinctively when she is being lied to, no matter how skillfully the liar obscures their deception (though she will not necessarily know what she is being lied to about if the liar makes more than one statement at one time). Whenever anyone with equal or fewer dots of Epic Manipulation than herself lies to her, the Scion may choose to roll her Manipulation instead of her Perception to attempt to notice the prevarication.

### TOTAL RECALL
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Presence

By specifically playing upon the instinctive memory triggers in his target’s environment, the Scion with this Knack may impress a memory so indelibly upon them that it becomes completely unforgettable. By giving his target a specific phrase, moment or memory that he wishes them to retain and spending a point of Legend, the Scion burns it into their memory, giving them complete and total recall of it no matter what else may transpire or how unimportant it might have seemed at the time. If the target fails to resist, only use of other Manipulation Knacks can remove the eternal reminder from his or her mind.

### TRENDSETTER
Prerequisite: Rumor Mill

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Politics

The fads and trends of the mortal (and even divine) world are as easy to manipulate for the Scion with this Knack as an individual’s actions might be. By finding a public place and intentionally performing some action, speaking some phrase, or simply existing in a unique fashion, the Scion may cause everyone around her to take note, and some to begin emulating her fashion or style automatically, believing it to be the best thing since sliced bread. The widespread staying power of the fad is dependent on conditions as with any trend, but the Scion may potentially affect astounding numbers of people with it if he so chooses, as determined by his successes:

| Successes | Trend’s Range  |
|--------|--------|
| 1 | Everyone in the neighborhood |
| 5 | Everyone in the city |
| 15 | Everyone in the urban areas of the region |
| 20 | Everyone in the urban areas of the country |
| 30 | Everyone in the country |
| 35 | Everyone in the hemisphere |
| 45 | Everyone in the World |
| 50 | Gods of the Scion’s pantheon |
| 60 | Gods of other pantheons |

The trend reaches its heyday in a number of days equal to the Scion’s successes, and lasts for a number of weeks equal to his Epic Manipulation successes.

### WHO, ME?
Prerequisite: Total Recall

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Politics

While taking center stage is all well and good at the appropriate moment, the Scion with this Knack also knows how to fade into the background when it becomes prudent to do so, making herself merely a bystander to whatever might be going on. By spending the requisite cost, the Scion makes herself so innocuous that others immediately discount her as harmless and unimportant for the remainder of the scene; in combat, no enemy will bother with her unless she is the only one left standing, while in any non-violent scene she becomes so unnoticeable that others may forget she was there entirely. The Scion herself must take care to keep her harmless façade intact, however; she cannot take any violent action while under the effects of this Knack, and cannot make herself a key player or heavily involved party in whatever is transpiring around her. If she does so, this Knack’s effects end immediately and everyone is free to notice her again.

### HEY, THAT’S MY LINE!
Prerequisite: God’s Honest

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

It’s not much of a step for Scions who employ manipulative tactics to be able to intuit when these tactics are being used on him. He may add his dots in Manipulation to his MDV. This Knack may only stack with two other Tier 2 resistance Knacks.

### WEAVER OF WEBS
Prerequisite: Hey, That’s My Line!

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

Just as a spider cannot be caught in her own web, a true expert of mind-tangling is especially keen when it comes to identifying and eluding similar tangles. She may use her automatic successes in Epic Manipulation instead of Legend when calculating MDV. This Knack does not stack with Untouchable Presence, Disorienting Countenance, Audit Self, Parapet of the Mind, or Crazy Like a Fox.

### AURA OF DREAD
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Horrible, hideous, unsettling or terrifying, the Scion with this Knack is so disturbing to look at that others simply avoid getting close enough to do so. Once the Scion has spent the requisite cost for this Knack, it becomes impossible for mortals to bar or block his progress, allowing him to part crowds and stride through traffic while others scramble to get out of his way. Those with a Legend score may approach and impede him if they wish, but they must spend a point of Willpower in order to do so.

This Knack may only be used by someone with negative Epic Appearance.

### BEDAZZLING IMAGE
Prerequisite: Blinding Visage

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this knack is so visually impressive – whether divinely beautiful or torturously ugly – that those attempting to affect her mentally are at a disadvantage from plain distraction. She may add her Appearance to any dice roll made to resist being affected by an outside power.

### BLINDING VISAGE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

The Scion with this Knack may concentrate his amazing appearance so as to literally attack those who gaze upon him. If he is beautiful, those affected wander in a daze, temporarily blinded and overwhelmed by the splendor of his visage; if he is hideous they panic, struck blind by the horror of the sight of him. The Scion may only blind up to a total number of people equal to his dots of Epic Appearance, and may only blind any specific person once per use; mortals are blinded for the remainder of the scene, while beings with Legend ratings are sightless for only a turn. The Scion’s targets must be looking directly at him in order for this Knack to affect them.

### CENTER OF ATTENTION
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

Irresistible to the eye, the Scion with this Knack forces those around her to pay attention to her and only her, drawing their eyes no matter what else might be going on in their vicinity. For every point of Legend she chooses to spend, her targets (she may affect up to her successes in individual beings) are locked into staring at her (though they may otherwise act normally) for one full minute per dot of Epic Appearance she possesses, enabling her to command every person’s attention for a heroic speech or to draw a foe’s ire in battle. Those who wish to take any action not directly involving the Scion suffer a -4 dice penalty in order to do so, as do those making Perception rolls to notice anything other than the Scion.

### CHAMELEON
Prerequisite: Mask the Divine

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

As changeable as the weather, the Scion with this Knack may now cause her ichor to give off false signals, blending in even with other pantheons around her. Whenever she chooses to pay the requisite cost, she may choose to read as any other pantheon to those using Scent the Divine, and in addition may smell like whatever she wishes, whether or not it would normally be possible (i.e., rose petals, ozone, or anything else she wants).

### COME HITHER
Prerequisite: Perfect Actor

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Command

When a Scion possesses this Knack, his presence is so striking that at any time he may use it to influence those who have seen him to come to him, even if they are currently far away. By spending the requisite cost and in some way calling the target (who need not be able to actually receive the message, but who may not have more Epic Appearance than he does), the Scion immediately engenders a strong, undeniable urge in them to come to his location at once (though they are not forced to take any imminently life-threatening measures in order to do so). Those seeking the Scion do so only for one full day; if, at the end of each day, they have not yet reached him, they may make an extended Willpower + Integrity roll against him, adding successes to it each day until they either reach him or overcome his threshold successes and are freed from the compulsion (the target must make this roll, as her natural resistance to meddling does not allow her to relent even if she genuinely wishes to find the Scion). If the Scion moves more than a mile from the place where he first called his target, the spell breaks and they are no longer compelled to find him; likewise, if he is on a different plane or otherwise inaccessible to his target, the compulsion breaks when the target reaches a touchstone or Axis Mundi and can go no further.

This Knack may only be used by someone with positive Epic Appearance.

### COMPELLING PRESENCE
Prerequisite: Serpent’s Gaze

**Cost:** 1 Legend per target

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

So undeniable is the intense attraction of the Scion’s presence that she can use this Knack to literally freeze others in their tracks. By spending a point of Legend for every person she wishes to affect, the Scion causes them to stop whatever they are doing and simply stare at her, drinking in the sight of her divine beauty. She may only affect targets that she is currently able to see, and only a number of targets equal to her successes from Epic Appearance; the targets remain thus frozen until she leaves their sight or until they are physically hurt, at which point they instantly regain their senses. In fact, the Scion’s presence is so overwhelming that her targets have no memory of the time they lost in contemplating her, and likewise forget an equal amount of time before this Knack was used, burned out of their brains by the Scion’s unearthly image. If the Scion attempts to use this Knack on the same person more than once in the same scene, her target adds their Willpower + Integrity again to their resistance roll as bonus dice for every time the Scion has already used it on them.

This Knack may only be used by someone with positive Epic Appearance.

### DETAIL VARIATION
Prerequisite: My Eyes Are Up Here

**Cost:** 1 Legend per feature

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack may change any minor details of his appearance at whim; hair, skin and eye colors, hair lengths and so forth are totally mutable for him as long as the desired effect falls within the range of normal human appearance (i.e., he may change his skin to most shades of tan or brown, but not to blue). Changes wrought by this Knack are permanent unless reversed by other Appearance Knacks or powers.

### DISORIENTING COUNTENANCE
Prerequisite: Bedazzling Image

**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Some Titans and Gods (and some of their spawn) have developed partial immunity even to the amazing effects of a Scion’s Epic Appearance, but that is not to say that they are completely free of its influence. For the price of one point of Legend plus the cost of the Knack or Boon used against him (as well as one more for every dot of Epic Appearance the attacker has over the Scion), he may remove his Legend from his resistance roll and instead add his Epic Appearance auto-successes to his total (though, since this is a function of her appearance and not her mental faculties, this Knack cannot be combined with Parapet of the Mind or Crazy Like a Fox).

### DIVINE SPLENDOR
Prerequisite: Disorienting Countenance

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

So unbelievably overwhelming is the Scion’s appearance, whether she possesses heavenly beauty or hellish ugliness, that it is literally too much for others to bear when she unleashes it fully. Whenever she pays the requisite cost, her target is overcome by the sheer dazzling force of her appearance; mortals die instantly, their minds and eyes seared and blasted by the overload, and beings of Legend are blinded for one full day by the awesome force of her visage.

### DOIN’ FINE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack never shows ill effects related to injuries or dirt on her actual body. If she is injured, bruises and cuts do not appear on her, no matter how grievously damaged she is in actuality; likewise, her skin always seems perfectly clean and blemishness, even if she’s been slogging through a sewer for the past few hours. This Knack does not actually affect anything except for the Scion’s outward appearance, and does not extend to the Scion’s clothes or anything she might be carrying.

This Knack may only be used by someone with positive Epic Appearance.

### DO NOT WANT
Prerequisite: Aura of Dread

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

A Knack reserved exclusively for Scions whose appearance tends toward the hideous end of the cosmic spectrum rather than the lovely, this power allows its possessor to become so visually terrifying that those around him literally cannot bring themselves to come into contact with such a horrifying creature. When he activates this Knack, anyone wishing to attack or even touch him must equal his roll or find themselves afflicted with a terrible, instinctive fear against doing so, which manifests itself as a penalty equal to the Scion’s Epic Appearance dots in successes applied to all melee, brawl or other close-quarters combat they attempt to level against him. This Knack does not affect those with more hideous Epic Appearance than the Scion himself, and does not affect ranged attacks. The horrible compulsion lasts for a number of turns equal to ½ the Scion’s successes, after which he reverts to his usual self.

This Knack may only be used by someone with negative Epic Appearance.

### DREADFUL MIEN
Prerequisite: Aura of Dread

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence 

By revealing the awful divine ugliness of her visage, the Scion with this Knack may so terrify her target that she forces them to flee, wildly doing anything and everything short of causing themselves injury to escape her presence. Those thus ejected must run until the next sunrise, and cannot voluntarily do anything in the Scion’s presence except attempt to escape; if cornered by the Scion, the target may lash out in self-defense. This Knack does not affect those with more hideous Epic Appearance than the Scion herself.

This Knack may only be used by someone with negative Epic Appearance.

### EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
Prerequisite: Visage Great and Terrible

**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Like a many-faceted jewel, the Scion with this Knack is able to control what face he presents to his onlookers, becoming the complete master of how others see him. Upon spending the activation cost, the Scion immediately chooses which beings in the scene (and any new ones that enter, whenever they do so ) he wishes to see him with positive Epic Appearance and which he chooses to see him with negative; those people see him as such for the remainder of the scene, causing half a crowd to sigh in ecstasy over his beauty and the other half to cower in terror from his hideousness. If he also possesses the My Eyes Are Up Here Knack, he may dictate that some also see him as forgettable by spending an additional point of Legend.

### GAME FACE
Prerequisite: Star Power

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

By revealing the terrible divine glory of her visage, the Scion with this Knack may so intimidate her target that she prevents him from being able to lay a hand on her, instinctively backing away from the temerity of such an idea. Whenever she overcomes her opponent’s resistance roll, the Scion renders him incapable of taking any violent action toward her for the rest of the scene; he may do anything else he wishes, but the Scion herself is immune to any attack while she stands wreathed in her overwhelming beauty.

This Knack may only be used by someone with positive Epic Appearance.

### INESCAPABLE VISION
Prerequisite: Lasting Impression

**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

The Scion with this Knack is so hauntingly beautiful or viscerally terrifying that it is almost impossible for those who see him to get him out of their minds. When any person or creature is looking at him, he may choose to spend the requisite cost; if he does, the hapless target is plagued by insistent recurring visions of the Scion, like a retinal afterimage burned into his or her brain. He or she sees all other people of the appropriate sex as wearing the Scion’s face, no matter who or where; he or she may spend a point of Willpower to temporarily stave off this maddening effect, but after one hour the visions return, allowing him or her no peace from seeing the Scion’s face everywhere, and the constant presence prevents him or her from regaining any points of Willpower while thus affected. Hapless targets suffer a -4 dice penalty to all actions during this time from the distraction of constantly being confronted by the Scion; in addition, anyone attempting to correctly identify a person of the same sex as the Scion loses four successes from their attempt to do so. Beings with a Legend rating may shake the effects off on their own after 24 hours; mortals, however, are doomed to see the Scion’s face forever unless he chooses to release them from it.

### LASTING IMPRESSION
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

Whatever a target of this Knack might think about the Scion, there’s no denying that she can’t be forgotten. When the Scion spends the requisite point of Legend, she causes her target to think about her godly appearance during idle moments, boosting their spirits or flattening them utterly. If the Scion is beautiful she grants her target a point of Willpower (which can be in excess of their normal maximum) and a dice bonus equal to your total number of dots of Epic Appearance to all Art, Athletics and Integrity rolls for the next 24 hours; if she is hideous, her target loses a point of Willpower which cannot be regained until the effects wear off, and suffers the same penalty to all Animal Ken, Command, Politics and Presence rolls as the memory of her terrifying face prevents him or her from concentrating on anything fully.

### LOATHSOME PRESENCE
Prerequisite: Waking Nightmare

**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

By embracing the true terror of his divine heritage, the Scion with this Knack makes it nearly impossible for any but the most stalwart to approach him. Whenever he chooses to pay this Knack’s activation cost, his horrifying presence and supreme ugliness become highlighted; for any being that comes within 20 yards of him must roll to resist or flee as if affected by the Dreadful Mien Knack, unable to stand being in such close proximity to such a monster. This Knack’s effects last for the remainder of the scene, after which point the Scion becomes loathsome but tolerable again (by those with strong stomachs, anyway).

### MALLEABLE ALLURE
Prerequisite: Mask the Divine

**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is such a master of his appearance that he may bend it to his will completely, becoming as noticeable or innocuous as he wishes. Whenever he chooses to pay the requisite cost, he may set his Epic Appearance to any level from zero to his maximum for the remainder of the scene; all onlookers see him as his new level of Epic Appearance and treat him accordingly, and all Appearance Knacks he uses during this time use his new Epic Appearance. He may revert his Epic Appearance to its normal level before the end of the scene if he wishes, but he must pay this Knack’s activation cost again to do so.

### MASK THE DIVINE
Prerequisite: Doin’ Fine

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack knows that appearance is about more than merely the eyes, and her control of her pheromones and subtle scent signals is unparalleled. Whenever she chooses to pay for this Knack, she may disguise her divine scent, becoming as unnoticeable as a mortal; she no longer appears to be a Scion to anyone using the Scent the Divine Knack. The Scion may remain innocently mortal-seeming for the remainder of the scene, after which her divine ichor surges back to normal.

### MY EYES ARE UP HERE
Prerequisite: None

**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

Despite the many benefits that being ineffably beautiful or terrifying might provide a Scion, sometimes it’s inconvenient to have a cavalcade of mortals following her around, or to instantly clear every room she walks into. By spending the requisite cost, the Scion with this Knack may temporarily disable the effects of her Epic Appearance; she reverts to zero in both her normal and Epic dots of Appearance, and may interact more freely with others who may not know her true nature. Since her Epic Appearance is not active, however, she cannot use Knacks provided by it. The Scion is entirely forgettable and mortals cannot later remember or recognize her or describe her in any detail; the nondescript appearance lasts until the end of the scene, or until the Scion chooses to return to her full glory.

### PERFECT ACTOR
Prerequisite: Center of Attention

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Art (some form of performance)

The Scion’s control over his body and face is so minute and perfect, backed up by his incredible gorgeousness, that he can communicate and incite emotion in others like the most masterful of thespians. By spending the requisite cost and in some way portraying an emotion – acting out a scene, making a speech, or simply dropping to his knees and sobbing – the Scion causes all those who see him to immediately feel that emotion with an overwhelming intensity for the remainder of the scene.

This Knack may only be used by someone with positive Epic Appearance.

### SERPENT’S GAZE
Prerequisite: Inescapable Vision

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

The Scion with this Knack is literally irresistible to the eye. If she makes eye contact and spends the requisite point of Legend, her target is instantly and inescapably fascinated by her, unable to do anything but maintain their mutual gaze. If the Scion loses eye contact with her victim or he sustains damage, he is immediately snapped out of it. This Knack may be used on a specific target only once per scene.

### STAR POWER
Prerequisite: Doin’ Fine

**Cost:** None

**Dice Pool:** None

A Scion with this much Epic Appearance is just too cool to be inconvenienced by everyday grooming hassles like dirt and bodily fluids. Incidental damage to her appearance simply doesn’t happen anymore – she doesn’t bleed when injured, she doesn’t sweat when it’s hot, she doesn’t get dirty when she works hard, and the wind definitely doesn’t disturb her immaculately-coiffed hair one bit. Even her clothing remains pristine and perfect unless she wishes for it to be otherwise.

### TAILOR MADE
Prerequisite: My Eyes Are Up Here

**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Incredible beauty is all well and good, but the Scion with this Knack knows that the clothes make the man, too. By concentrating for a moment and spending a point of Legend, he may cause clothing to grow forth and cover his body, coalescing from his very godly ichor. This garment can look like whatever he likes (though it cannot provide armor bonuses) is permanent, and acts like normal clothing in every way once it is created. If at any time the clothing leaves physical contact with the Scion, it disintegrates.

### UNDENIABLE RESEMBLANCE
Prerequisite: Detail Variation

**Cost:** 5 Legend per feature

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion’s control over her appearance is now so great that she can stretch and shape it into anything within the spectrum of normal human variation. She may change skin and hair colors at whim, grow into a basketball player or shrink into a midget, completely change her race, swap genders, or even become a hermaphrodite. All alterations to her appearance are real, affecting even her DNA; they are permanent unless she chooses to change them again with this or another Appearance Knack. If the Scion wishes to impersonate a specific person with equal or lesser Epic Appearance, she may do so, but those who possess higher Epic Perception than she does may realize that it is an impostor (or, if they have never met the person before, merely realize that something is slightly off).

### UNUSUAL ALTERATION
Prerequisite: Undeniable Resemblance

**Cost:** 2 Legend per feature

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack can now create whatever outlandish modifications to himself he wishes, whether they are within the realm of human imagination or so fantastic that they defy description. He may add limbs or heads, grow a tail or wings, turn his bones into sculptures or utilize colors never found in nature; his imagination is the only limit, though changes typically do not afford any concrete dice bonuses (unless otherwise ruled by the Storyteller). All changes he makes to his appearance are permanent unless he chooses to change them again with this or another Appearance Knack.

### VISAGE GREAT AND TERRIBLE
Prerequisite: Inescapable Vision

**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Knack is not bound to only appear as a hideous beast or a gorgeous goddess; she may become either at her whim, spending the requisite cost to switch from one to the other or vice versa at any time she pleases.

### WAKING NIGHTMARE
Prerequisite: Dreadful Mien

**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Appearance + Presence

The Scion with this Knack is so terrifying that the horror of his hideous visage cannot be confined to a single unfortunate target. Whenever he spends the activation cost and shows his true horror with a snarl, shout or other threatening gesture, all those who are able to see him in the area must immediately roll to resist as if affected by the Dreadful Mien Knack or flee in abject terror. The commanding officer of an opposing army may attempt to roll Charisma + Command against the Scion’s activation successes in order to prevent his men from routing, but if he is not successful must watch helplessly as they run wildly from the Scion’s unthinkable presence.
