The Guardian purview can never be used offensively; it can only be used for purposes of protection and guarding, and simply refuses to work if a Scion attempts to use it to cause another harm.

### VIGIL BRAND ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon may extend her divine protection to anyone she deems worthy. By touching the intended target, she places a magical brand on their skin, invisible to normal eyes (though it appears as a faintly-glowing tattoo to those using The Unlidded Eye spell); thereafter, she will immediately know when the target is in danger, and be able to get a general sense of what is happening to him or her if she is not in the immediate area. This brand is permanent unless the Scion voluntarily chooses to relinquish it, at which point it fades from the target’s skin; if she wishes to re-brand that target, she must again touch them and spend the requisite Legend. Alternatively, the Scion may extend her protection to a place or object of great importance, laying a brand on a doorway or object that she has likewise sworn to protect from harm. A Scion may only have a number of active Vigil Brands equal to her total number of Guardian Boons squared, with a minimum of three.

### WARNING LINE ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Awareness

By tracing a line on the ground or around any opening, the Scion may gain a preternatural awareness of it, even when he is no longer nearby. Upon creating his line (which may be of any length as long as he creates it in one uninterrupted pass), he names a creature or being (titanspawn, human, Scion, Kane Taoka, anyone under five feet tall, etc.); thereafter, he is instantly aware if any specimen of the named creature crosses her line. He may have any number of Warning Lines active at one time and may effortlessly distinguish between them; they remain for a number of days equal to his successes, after which point they vanish and he must re-trace them if he wishes to regain awareness of the area. The warning line appears normal to unaugmented eyes, but those using The Unlidded Eye spell see it as a glowing threshold.

### AEGIS ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Fortitude

The Scion with this Boon may provide concrete protection to the most fragile of her charges; by touching the intended target and spending the requisite cost, she may give them soaks equal to her successes, making them extremely difficult to hurt by most mortal means. This Boon lasts for 24 hours and may only be used on mortals or objects with no Legend rating of their own; the Scion may not use it twice in one day on the same person or object, though a second Scion with this Boon may add his protection to hers.

### DIVINE PASS ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Presence

Difficulty: Varies

The Scion with this Boon is a law unto himself, instantly recognized and waved past as a defender in any situation. He may enter any establishment or area without fear of being stopped by the local law enforcement or security forces, which automatically recognize him as one of their own. The difficulty of convincing the security force of this depends entirely on the place in question (walking blithely onto Mount Olympus, for example, is much more difficult than getting into an exclusive club). The Scion may linger as long as he wishes, provided that he does not incite violence or commit any theft or vandalism; if he does so, all security forces in the area are instantly alerted to his presence and know his exact location at all times until he leaves, making for a very sticky situation indeed. This Boon may only be used for innocent or noble purposes; if the Scion has any malicious intent, it simply will not work, and he’ll most likely be stopped at the door.

### FOREBODING ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Presence

By extending a small portion of her divine presence over someone or something she wishes to protect, the Scion with this Boon may cause even the most stalwart of men to reconsider thwarting her will. By touching a person or object and spending the requisite cost, the Scion causes a powerful feeling of dismay and misgiving to assail anyone who considers doing harm to the target she has thus protected. Weaker-willed mortals and animals may simply change their minds in the face of such a powerful bad feeling, while those who are determined to attack the target anyway must roll their Willpower + an appropriate Virtue and score more successes than the Scion’s total number of Guardian Boons in order to do so; failure indicates that the feeling of impending disaster is too overwhelming to ignore, though the attacker may spend a point of Willpower to go through with his plan anyway. The aura of the Scion’s power remains for a number of days equal to her successes.

### WARD ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Fortitude

The Scion with this Boon may place an invisible ward on any location that he wishes to protect; when he does so, he may name a specific type of person or creature (titanspawn, human, Scion, Kane Taoka, anyone under five feet tall, etc.) that will be barred entry to the location. Named creatures of Legend rating less than the Scion’s fail automatically at any attempts to come too close to the place (the ward has a radius of 5 yards times the Scion’s total number of Guardian Boons, though he may choose to make it smaller if he wishes). The ward has a soak equal to twice the Scion’s total number of Guardian Boons and has a number of health levels equal to ten times his total number of Guardian Boons. The protective sphere remains in effect for a number of days equal to the Scion’s successes, after which point it dissipates completely; the Scion may choose to ward an area against more than one type of threat, but to do so he must pay the cost and roll the dice pool multiple times.

### UNSEEN SHIELD ●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Fortitude

With a thought, the Scion with this power may create a shimmering, near-invisible field of power around herself and anyone else she wishes to protect, and may extend it in any direction to a maximum of 4 yards per Guardian Boon she possesses. She may allow or disallow access to the shield’s protection to any beings she chooses, and may change those choices at will throughout the course of the scene. Those within the sphere are automatically protected from ghosts and mortals as they are unable to batter their way through the magical barrier; beings of Legend may attempt to break through the shield, which has a soak equal to the twice the Scion’s total number of Guardian Boons and a number of health levels equal to her successes. As the shield is meant to defend the helpless, it will not tolerate violence; anyone (including the Scion herself) who takes or attempts to take a violent action while within its sphere of protection is instantly ejected and cannot be allowed back into the shield for the remainder of the scene. If the shield is destroyed in combat, the Scion may re-cast it as many times as she wishes to pay for it; if it is not destroyed, it disappears at the end of the scene.

### COME RUNNING ●●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

A guardian Scion can’t always be everywhere, but once he’s mastered this Boon, he can get impressively close to it. At any time that he senses that a person or place he has marked with a Vigil Brand is in danger, he may pay the Legend cost to instantly teleport to that location, appearing within sight of the source of danger. He may only use this Boon when his charge is in imminent danger.

### I SAY THEE NAY! ●●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Integrity

The Scion with this Boon cannot be swayed from her mission by any force, earthly or divine; when she activates this power and chooses a person or place to defend, she becomes nigh-impervious to attempts to distract or persuade her away, and gains a preternatural stamina when it comes to defending her chosen charge. For each success she rolls, the difficulty of any attempt to fool, intimidate, or distract her is increased by 1, and any penalty from wounds, poisons, drugs, or other hindering effects is reduced by 1. In addition, she becomes a whirlwind of defensive action, gaining a DV bonus equal to her successes against anyone who attempts to attack her charge or prevent her from defending it; the person or place she has chosen to protect also gains the benefits of the Scion’s enhanced DV, provided that the Scion herself remains standing and able to give her all in their defense. The Scion’s supernatural commitment remains for the remainder of the scene, unless she intentionally chooses to rescind her protection or she dies in the line of duty.

### CONFER KNACK ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By feeding a mortal (human or animal) a bit of his ichor (through his blood or other bodily fluids), the Scion may give them the ability to use any one Stamina knack that he himself possesses. The Knack must not have any prerequisites that the mortal does not already possess, and functions exactly as it does for the Scion (though mortals must spend Willpower instead of Legend, if such is the Knack’s cost). The Knack’s benefits remain for a number of years equal to the Scion’s total number of Guardian Boons, after which the mortal is unable to access them again. The Scion may not give a single mortal more than one Knack at a time, though others who also possess this Boon may add other Knacks to the same mortal if they so desire.

### WATCHER AT THE THRESHOLD ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon need never fear illicit activity occurring in her domain or in any area under her charge; if she has placed a Vigil Brand on the opening or entrance (a door, window, tunnel, etc.) to any location, she becomes instantly aware when any being attempts to pass through it. Should she decide to halt the incursion, she may simply pay the Legend cost to instantly appear on the threshold, ready to defend her demesne. She may likewise activate this Boon when a Warning Line she has laid is crossed. This Boon may only be used to teleport between Warning Lines and Vigil Brands laid on locations; it has no effect on living beings.

### CONFER IMMUNITY ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

By sharing a bit of his ichor (through his blood or other bodily fluids) with a mortal (human or animal), the Scion may gift them with any supernatural immunity that he himself possesses. The Boon thus conferred functions exactly as it does for the Scion, and lasts for a number of years equal to the Scion’s total number of Guardian Boons. The Scion may not give a single mortal more than one immunity at a time, though others who also possess this Boon may add other immunities to the same mortal if they so desire. The Scion may choose to use this Boon to bestow any of the following immunity Boons on the mortal of his choice: Eye of the Storm, Night Eyes, Safely Interred, Electrical Immunity, Fire Immunity, Frost Immunity, Penetrating Glare, Sky’s Grace, or Water Breathing.

### NONE SHALL PASS ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Awareness

The Scion with this Boon is so attuned to defending her charges that no one, not even those with divine power, can pass her with impunity. Whenever she chooses to spend the requisite cost, she may place an area with a radius of up to 100 yards per success she rolls under her protection, placing it on magical lockdown; no Boons may be used to enter it via supernatural means while she is on guard. Boons such as Earth Travel, Divine Pass, Flame Travel or the majority of the Psychopomp purview simply fail to work when used to attempt to enter the area without the Scion’s blessing unless the being using them can best the Scion’s successes with a Wits + Stealth roll. The Scion may allow anyone she trusts the ability to use traveling powers within the area, but those who do not ask her permission and fail to overcome her iron resolve find themselves simply standing where they started, having inexplicably failed to move. The area remains thus protected until the Scion leaves it, at which point it may be freely traveled through again.

### APPROPRIATED VIGIL ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 1 or 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** Perception + Empathy

Difficulty: Target’s total number of Vigil Brands

The Scion with this Boon has such sensitivity to the plight of those she can defend that she may even take on the defense of others that she has not personally protected with her Vigil Brand Boon. She may spend one point of Legend to check a Vigil Brand placed by anyone to whom she is Fatebound, placed by any Scion of her own, or placed using any relic that her ichor has given access to the Guardian purview; if she chooses to spend all 5 points of Legend, she may have an awareness of all of that target’s Vigil Brands for the remainder of the day, able to check on them and feel their danger as if they were her own. If she possesses the Come Running or Watcher at the Threshold Boons, she may use them in conjunction with her target’s Vigil Brands as she would normally.

### ENTREAT IMMUNITY ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend and 1 Willpower per use

**Dice Pool:** None

Even the most eagle-eyed of guardians can’t plan for every eventuality; the Scion that buys this Boon may drastically raise the chances of any particular person or object he chooses to protect, even in his absence. By choosing a small sample of a substance, element, or item to bind to his target, the Scion may entreat that item and all others like it to avoid harming his target by any means, rendering the target effectively immune to any hurt from that source. The substance or item in question may be literally anything that the Scion is able to carry a piece of with him – a substance such as iron or wood, an item such as a sword or a gun, or even an element such as water; however, it should be noted that this Boon is very specific, and that only the exact item in question will bestow its immunity on the target. Many a chagrined Scion has discovered that protection from guns does not include protection from bullets, or that protection from fire does not include protection from smoke. The immunity granted to the target is permanent so long as the Scion continues to carry the object or substance’s token on his person; if he ever loses or intentionally divests himself of it, however, the target in question will become abruptly vulnerable again, with no warning of his or her change in state. The Scion may place as many immunities as he likes on a single target, but the cost of doing so is prohibitive at best; he must pay a permanent dot of Willpower to use this Boon on any target of Legend rating 8 or above, and likewise spend a permanent dot if a target upon which he has used this Boon in the past attains a Legend rating of 8.

### DIVINE RESOLVE ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

A guardian Scion is so unshakable in her commitment to her charges’ defense that she may even bestow upon them some of her own divine certainty. Whenever she is made aware by any means that someone is facing overwhelming temptation or irresistible pressure to abandon their cause (anything that requires them to make a resistance roll), she may choose to reflexively activate this Boon in order to add twice her total number of Guardian Boons as automatic successes to her target’s roll, bolstering them with her courage and divine vision. She may use this power on any target she wishes, so long as they are in need of her aid.

### WARDEN OF THE WALLS ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend and 2 Willpower dots per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon has chosen to take on the weighty responsibility of acting as protector for an entire city, keeping his people safe from all harm through his ever-vigilant patronage. By performing a public ritual in which he declares his patronage for all to hear, the god elects himself the defender of the entire area around him up to the borders of the city; when he pays the requisite cost to do so, he spends two dots of Willpower, which cannot be rebought as long as he continues to act as the city’s defender. Once he has taken the city under his wing, the Scion instantly gains instinctive knowledge of any dangers besetting any legitimate citizens of it as if they were marked with a Vigil Brand (these do not count toward his maximum total number of Vigil Brands), and all citizens automatically gain the effects of his Foreboding Boon as they are marked with the god’s favor. These effects remain in place only while the citizens are in the city; if they leave, they remove themselves from the Scion’s aegis. The Scion also gains an automatic Vigil Brand on all permanent buildings and structures within the city, and need pay only one point of Legend to use his Come Running or Watcher at the Threshold Boons to come to the defense of anyone or anything within city limits. While he is within city limits, the None Shall Pass Boon is in effect for free at all times; the cost for him to use the Confer Knack, Confer Immunity or Divine Resolve Boons on any citizen of his city is reduced by two points of Legend, and he need not be within city limits to enjoy these benefits. If at any point the Scion chooses to rescind favor and cease to act as the city’s protector, he may do so at no cost to himself, and he immediately regains the two dots of Willpower he spent to activate this Boon.

### SALVATION SACRIFICE ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion with this Boon is so dedicated to his role that he may become a literal shield for those he protects, absorbing all harm directed their way without a second thought. At any time that someone or something that he has marked with a Vigil Brand is attacked, he may spend the Legend cost to take all damage inflicted himself, leaving the object of his protection unscathed. This damage is subject to the Scion’s normal armor and soak, and he may take as many hits as he is willing to pay for. Attacks that cause no damage may not be redirected with this Boon.

### THE SENTINEL
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene

**Dice Pool:** None

The Scion becomes the ultimate protector, capable of defending an entire city or territory and blocking even titans and gods from passing without his permission.
